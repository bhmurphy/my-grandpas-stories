In his later years, my grandpa wrote memoirs, which he called his "stories." Many of these he re-wrote several
times over several years. Many are unfinished.

I lost my grandpa in November of 2023.

I wanted to publish his stories here as a testament to the man who most made me who I am today. I've organized each story
as best as I can, but have presented them without edits or omissions, to keep them as authentic as he was. This
includes the typos, punctuation errors, and bits of placeholder text that show that these were very much a work in
progress.

Love you.
