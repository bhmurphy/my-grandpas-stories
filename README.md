# My Grandpa's Stories

A simple Jekyll website I put together to convert my grandfather's memoirs into a site for my family.

This site makes heavy use of the [Just the Docs Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs)

Additionally, it utilizes the [Jekyll Tabs plugin](https://github.com/Ovski4/jekyll-tabs) to support multiple
versions of the same story on the same page.
