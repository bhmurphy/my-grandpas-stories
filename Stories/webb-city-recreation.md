Webb City Recreation or the “pool hall” as it was commonly known, was at 110 W. Daugherty St. in Webb City.  The pool hall was owned and operated from 1944 to 1971 by Lester “Les” Ulmer, my godfather.  My father Dan Murphy was a good Irish catholic and as was the custom in the days when my three brothers and I were born, we all had godfathers.  None of us were christened by the church, mainly because my mother was a Baptist and would have none of that.   We were however all named after our godfathers.  Melvin the oldest was named after Melvin Lee Macy (Melvin Lee Murphy), Dave after David Allen (David Allen Murphy), Vern after Vern Wilder (Vern Eugene Murphy) and I was named after Les Ulmer (James Lester Murphy).  As it was explained to me when I was old enough to understand it was an honor for the godparent to have a child named after them and also if anything ever happened to Mom and Dad our godparents would take us to raise as their own.  That need never arose I’m happy to say.  Had it arisen though I don’t think I could have ask for better godparents than Les and his wife Bea Ulmer.  Les and my father were both born in Webb City, lived there all of their lives and were lifelong friends and business partners for a time.

I’d like to describe the pool hall as best I can.  My recollection of the pool hall would be from the 1950’s and 60’s.  Located across the alley (West) from Merchants and Miners Bank, next to Webb City Hardware and directly across the street form Johnson’s Feed Store, the pool hall was home away from home for many a young man in Webb City.  I’m sure there was a minimum age for admittance.  I can’t recall what that age was but I think it was thirteen years old.  I guess girls were allowed but I don’t remember ever seeing one in there, girls just weren’t attracted to pinball machines and pool tables.

I can still picture in my mind’s eye the layout of the place.  The front door was on the North West corner of the building.  The hall was one big room about 25 by 60 ft.  As you came in the door on your right were three pinball machines, further down the wall was a big wooden couch with red leather upholstery.   On your left (East wall) there was a big wood and glass counter.  Behind the counter stood a very large Ardmore with a big mirror in the middle.  The Ardmore housed all the tobacco products, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco etc.  The counters were full of all kinds of good stuff, candy, chips, peanuts and boxes of assorted chocolates.  On top of the counter were the punchboards.  The punchboards were for adults only.  For a dime apiece or three for a quarter you could punch out little pieces of paper, if you were lucky and punched out the right one you won  a box of chocolates.  My dad used to bring home boxes of candy from time to time. Behind you against the North wall between the door and counter were a coke machine and an ice crème chest; you could purchase a pint of ice crème for twenty cents, pop sickles for five cents. Cokes were five cents, no deposit, no return.

The pool tables were lined up in a row down the center of the room from side to side from about where the wooden couch with the red leather upholstery stood to the south end of the room.  The first table on the north end was a billiard table (no pockets just three balls) the next table was a snooker table (big table with small balls and pockets).  The rest were regulation eight ball tables, about six or eight of them.  On the west wall overlooking the tables were a row of chrome chairs with red plastic upholstery where one could sit and watch his opponent run the table.  Or just sit and watch others play if you were short on cash.

The walls were a light green color from the floor up to about four feet and a crème color up to the ceiling.  There was a thin film of nicotine on the walls due to the fact that the room was always filled with smoke.  One didn’t really need to smoke in there all he had to do was breathe.

On the east wall were the cue racks, they were kind of a lazy Susan circular rack of about ten cues each.  At the end of the room was a small bathroom which was built into the southeast corner of the room.  Next to the bath room were three or four domino tables. Each one had a little square of flat black paint in each corners so you could keep score with chalk.  I can remember some pretty lively domino games going on back there. Every so often an argument would break out about who played the wrong domino.  They may have been playing for money.  I have no idea what it cost to play dominos but I think they charged per game.

Speaking of money, it cost five cents per game for eight ball and a penny per minute for billiards or snooker.   Since eight ball was “by the game” that was the most popular.  When the game ended you yelled out RACK! One of the employees would come, rack the balls collect a nickel and you were ready to go again. We played pool for money sometimes but mostly for fun.  I don’t remember any pool sharks around the pool hall.  Some of us thought we were but only in our dreams.

The real money games were played upstairs.  If you were known by the doorman and admitted access to the backroom and up the stairs you could play the slot machines, shoot craps or play poker.  The room was kind of dark but very nice and almost as big as the downstairs room.  There were several slot machines, one crap table and one or two poker tables.  There was a small lounge area well furnished and offered free drinks and food for the customers.  This is the part where my Dad and Les were partners.  My Dad died in the summer of 1959 at the age of 47 which ended the partnership.  I don’t think the games upstairs lasted very many years after that.

One Wednesday afternoon in 1971 Les went upstairs to get a newspaper and on the way down he fell and suffered injuries to the head which resulted in a blood clot on his brain.  He died the next day at St. John’s hospital in Springfield after undergoing surgery to remove the clot.  He was 68 years old.  His wife Bea sold out shortly after and Webb City Recreation was no more.
