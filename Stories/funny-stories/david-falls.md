# David falls 40 feet into Daylight Cave (*on a cold winter day*)

David was a little accident prone. He had a knack for getting into trouble or whatever.  One winter day he decided to go over to Daylight Cave and look for squabs, or young pigeons. They could be found in nests along the ledgeâ€™s rocks and crevices around the edges old Led and Zinc mine pits. Daylight Cave was the second biggest open pit mine next to Oronogo Circle.  Daylight was East of town between Webb and Carterville.

He was about 40 feet up on one ledge when he lost his balance and fell in the water. He had on a heavy winter coat, heavy hunting pants and boots. When he hit the water, he went under 10 or 15 feet. He jettisoned his coat and boots in order to swim and climb out of the pit and head for home about two miles away.  Thankfully, someone gave him a ride home in their car after he had walked halfway home.  He was probably half frozen by that time.
