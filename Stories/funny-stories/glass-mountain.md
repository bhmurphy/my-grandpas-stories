# The Glass Mountain

## *“City Stricken in Grip of Ice storm for 2nd Day” Webb City Daily Sentinel Jan 11, 1949.”*

### There we were standing on top of this big glass mountain, looking down and then at each other silently.  Then Someone said, “who’s going first?”

I remember that day my two brothers and I woke up to the most beautiful sight any of us had ever seen. During the night freezing rain had left Webb City covered with two inches of solid ice.  Trees and tree limbs were down, electricity was off, our water pipes were frozen. The city was at a standstill, but we did not care. Why? Because we knew that there would be NO SCHOOL that day, yahoo!!!

After breakfast, thanks to Mom’s good old gas range, we started thinking about what we could do that day which would provide the maximum amount of fun. Melvin, the oldest brother and leader of the Pac, suggested we go sledding down the huge tailing pile at the end of North Liberty Street just two blocks away. Now this was one of the biggest chat piles in the area, so big that from the top you could literarily see the whole city and cold watch airplanes take off and land at the Joplin airport, miles away.

Our little brother Vern was not born yet, and I was only five going on six (in February). I think the only reason they let me tag along was because they needed someone to carry our Two Man Western Flyer sled.  Jerry Wilson, Melvin’s friend who lived a block away went with us.  We carefully made our way down the alley between Liberty and Webb streets until it ended, then cut over to Webb Street and continued down until we were standing next to the East side of the chat pine covered with ice.

We were all standing there looking up and wondering how we could get to the top when Curtiss Smith another friend of Melvin’s shows up with a stove poker.  Using the stove poker to chip toe holds in the ice we made our way up single file, me at the end dragging the sled behind for what seemed like hours.

We finally reached the top of this enormous glass mountain; it may as well have been Mt. McKinley. Looking down the South side which was probably the least steep slope but still looked to us like the first run down a roller coaster. So, there we were standing there looking down and then at each other silently when someone said, “who’s going first?” No one volunteered, we were all thinking the same thing, this is solid ice, not snow, you could be killed going down this thing!

About that time the sled, which I had placed there beside us, started moving ever so slowly toward the edge. Seeing this, my brother David jumped on the sled belly first. (When ask why? Later he said, “To stop it!”) Poor David took off like a rocket, holding on for dear life.

We all stood there in horror as we watched him shoot down the icy slope like an Olympic Bobsledder gaining speed all the way down. When he hit bottom, he didn’t stop until he hit a big pile of rocks after going through three brier bushes and a barbed wire fence.  We saw little puffs of ice crystals as he went through each one.

By the time we made our way back down inch by inch, very carefully, very slowly, and recovered our slightly bent up Western Flyer sled and skated our way home, David had long since been there and was bring patched up by Mom. David didn’t have any broken bones but was not happy, a little embarrassed and looked like he had gone one on one with a Bobcat.
