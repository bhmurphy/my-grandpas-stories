# Vern fell on front steps and split his upper lip (*Twice*)

Vern who Doc. Slaughter called “troubles”, fell while running up the stairs on the front porch and split his upper lip which required 4 or 5 stiches.  The very next day he fell again while running up the same steps, fell in the same place, and split his lip in the same place. Doc. Slaughter stopped the bleeding and put a bandage on his lip and said, “I’m sorry I can’t do any more for him.” So, Vern had this crooked lip for the rest of his life.
