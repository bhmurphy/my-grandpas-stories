# There I was holding Vern by his ankle in one hand and the grate in my other hand.

**(LOOK FOR CORRECT PHOTO)**

We were eating dinner one night and Aunt Roberta was dining with us that evening. We had finished eating and were just sitting around the table in the dining room and talking.  Vern, who was about two or three years old at the time asked me to lift the grate in the floor over our furnace so he could retrieve a penny he had dropped in. The grate was in between the living room and the dining room. Under the grate there was screen wire stretched across the hole in the floor to catch whatever fell through the grate. The furnace was in the basement about six or seven feet below. It was summertime and the furnace was not on, so the heat was no problem.  Vern has on shorts and no shoes.  I got on my knees and lifted one edge of the grate and held it open for Vern.  When he reached for the penny, he put his other hand on the screen wire and dove headfirst into the hole right through the screen wire.  I managed to catch him by his ankle on one leg as he fell through the hole.  So, there I was holding Vern by his ankle with one hand and the heavy grate in the other. I yelled HELP! Which got everyone’s attention at the dinner table. My brother David ran over and helped me pull Vern out and lower the grate back in place.  We were incredibly lucky that Aunt Roberta was with us because Vern had cut his free leg on a nail or screw protruding from the edge of the hole.  She was a Registered Nurse and cleaned him up, put a bandage on the wound and declared “we do not have to go see Dr. Slaughter for stiches”.  And yes, Vern never let go of the penny.
