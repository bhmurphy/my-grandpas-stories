# David had a very High IQ (*But no common sense*)

I guess Mom and Dad noticed very early that David was much smarter than a normal child his age to they had him tested. His IQ was 160. I looked it up, the Average or Normal IQ is 100. An IQ above 140 is generally considered that of a genius. David was a walking encyclopedia; he never brought any homework from school. He was a straight A student. He never brought any homework from school. He got it all done during study hall. Most of what I learned about Biology, History, or Chemistry came from listening to David at the dinner table hearing what he had learned that day at school. I, however, was a poor student. Made terrible grades. When in the classroom rather than pay attention to the teacher, I was daydreaming or planning a rabbit or squirrel hunt after school. I did have a mechanical aptitude though. I enjoyed working on Mom or Dads car. Changing the oil, flat tires, new mufflers and or tailpipes. If anyone’s bicycle needed fixing, I was happy to do it. I took my bike apart and put it back together. I wish I hadn’t though, there are a lot of parts in the rear wheel hub.  That part was a real challenge. Back to David and his lack of common sense. There were three incidents involving the Coupe I will use as an example. The Coupe had an enclosed drive shaft which meant if we had to replace the transmission or clutch plate or whatever, we had to disconnect the drive shaft housing and pull the rearend out of the way. One time we broke the driveshaft and had to replace it. We had left the rear end still attached to the rear wheels out of the way. When it came time to put it all back together, I noticed that somehow, we had turned the Differential upside down. It was obvious to me because the filler plug was in the wrong position. I told Dave that we needed to turn it over, but he swore that I was wrong. We debated for quite some time, he got very mad, so I finally gave up and we put it in that way. When we started the engine and tried to back the car out of the garage, we had one gear forward three gears reverse. David finally admitted I was right, and he was wrong.

Another time We had just installed a new electric fuel pump which was in the trunk of the coupe along with the gas tank and battery. Dave had backed the coupe out on the side road (which was dirt and gravel) for a test drive. The engine died and we noticed smoke coming from the trunk area. The new fuel pump was smoking and about to catch on fire. David was scooping up gravel from the road and throwing it onto the pump. I ran up to the garage, got a wrench, came back and removed the negative lead of the battery. No more smoke.

The engine in the coupe was a Ford Flat Head V8. I think it is one of the most beautiful engines out there. As you can see the heads were Edelbrock Finned Aluminum, with chrome wire looms and nut covers. Those are Stromberg 97 two-barrel carbs on top. We believed that a Ford hot rod should have a Ford engine.

Since the heads were aluminum, it was important to be sure the sparkplug would not be cross threaded when plugs were replaced. When they were, it was necessary to remove the head, drill out the hole, then rethread to accept a brass Shem to accept a plug. After Dave replaced the plugs, we had to rework 2 holes that were cross threaded.

For a while we had an aircraft magneto which Dave borrowed from Delmer Moore who had a garage on South Liberty St. next to the Safeway store.  Delmer would help anyone who had a hot rod, race car or dragster. From time to time, he had all the above himself. The mag produced a very strong spark. You could just touch the starter button and the engine would start up. Delmer stopped by John Hutchins’s Auto Parts store where David worked and ask for the Mag.  He needed it for a drag Race at Mokan Raceway that weekend. David brought home a distributor to replace the Mag, removed it and replaced it with the Dist. He wired it up but when he started the engine it was backfiring like crazy. A few wires were misplaced. We switched a couple of wires, and it ran smoothly.

Another “crazy” thing he did was to come home drunk. Dave said later that he did not know why he did this. Dad was at work, Melvin was in Louisiana, Mom Vern and I were watching TV when we heard a car pull up outside and later Dave came stumbling in the side door. We all looked at him in disbelief. Then Mom realizing he was drunk, grabbed her trusty broom and chased Dave all the way up stares beating him with the wrong end of the broom.
