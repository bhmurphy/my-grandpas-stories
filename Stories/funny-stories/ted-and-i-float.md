# Ted and I took a float trip down Center creek.

## *Hold on Ted, I’ve got this!*

Ted and his wife, Lucy, bought a 40-acre farm on the old route 66 Hy near Lakeside after they were married. I was best man at their wedding.

Ted had his own Barber shop in Webb City and Lucy worked for Pennys at the mall on Range Line in Joplin. I had returned to Webb City from Tulsa Oklahoma where I had been for about seven- and one-half years working first for Cook Paint and Varnish Co. for about two years and six or seven years for North American Aviation on the Saturn Apollo Space program which put man on the moon. After I and several thousand people were laid off at North American one of my friends, Sam Jackson got me a job at Tri-State motor transit Company in Joplin in their accounting office running a ten key all day. I was renting a small two-bedroom house on South Washington St. in Webb City. Ted used to come by my place every weekday morning and we would have coffee together before going to work. I wasn’t too fond of the job, but it paid the rent and car payments with a little left over for food, etc. I had been working there for about one year when my brother Vern returned stateside from his tour of duty in Vietnam and mustered out of the Army at Ft. Bragg near Fayetteville, NC. Where Vern meat his first wife Angie and they had one sun, Micheal. In the meantime, Vern had gotten a job with Brown & Root company which had a contract to build a two-unit Nuclear Power plants in Southport, NC. Vern was working as an electrician. Tri-state had a toll free “Trunk Line.” We used to call truckers and do business over the phone anywhere in the US. From time to time, I would call Vern to see how he and Angie and little Micheal were doing. Vern told me that I might be able to get a job there because “there were instruments all over the place”, and with my experience with instrumentation at North American Aviation, I could Easley get a job there. I said, “well send me an application, I’ll fill it out and we’ll see what happens.” Brown & Root hired me as an instrument fitter earning twice what I made at Tri-State.

When I told Ted the good news he said, “Before you move to NC lets take a float trip down center creek together.” We planned our trip for that weekend. Ted’s wife Lucy dropped us off at the bridge on HY 71 that crossed center creek between Cartersville and Carthage and would pick us up at center creek bridge North of Webb City.

We had barrowed a fishing boat from Dick Bauer, which was a 10 Ft. flat bottom aluminum square ended design. We put the boat in just below the old Lakeside Dam. Loaded it with a six pack of beer, camera, and a lunch Basket. I was up front and Ted in the rear, we both had an Orr to guide the boat.

The first part of the trip was great. Slowly cruising downstream, enjoying the beautiful scenery, seeing parts of the river we had never seen before, with all the bluffs and caves along the way. I took many photos along the way; I wanted a record of our trip.  Ah life was great, just floating along, hardly having to paddle the boat to make small adjustments until…. About halfway down stream we came to a fork in the river, I looked back at Ted and said Right or Left? We went to the Right. Not much further downstream we came to a sharp bend. The water was getting very swift, and the current was so strong that we could not control the boat.  That was bad enough, but we were heading for a tree limb which stretched halfway across the river, and we were headed right for it. The limb was about chest high for me, so I thought I could grab the limb and stop the boat. I turned back to Ted and said, “Hold on Ted, I’ve got this!” turned back around and wham! next thing I know I’m sitting in the back of the boat on Ted’s lap, the boat filled up with water and sank, we watched as our six pack, lunch, and camera with some great photos on it went floating down the river.

We still had our Orrs, and the water wasn’t that deep, so we were able to right the boat, which wasn’t damaged and finish our very memorial float trip down Center Creek.
