# Dave and Vernie Barrow were building pipe bombs (*in the basement*)

David had converted the storm shelter in the basement into his Chemistry Lab. It was a small room which was under the front porch. It had a dirt floor and no lighting. He used a Bunsen burner or a kerosene lamp for light. He had built a table on one end of the room, so he had plenty of room for his chemistry set.  He and Vernie Barrow spent a lot of time down there experimenting.  They had learned how to make gun powder in school chemistry class.  They made a few pipe bombs and tested one out in the chicken yard.  It worked, a little too good, it worked.  Mom heard the explosion from inside the house. She let it be known in no uncertain terms, no more building bombs in the basement! Or anywhere else for that matter.
