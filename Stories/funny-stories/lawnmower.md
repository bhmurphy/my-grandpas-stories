# The new power lawn mower.

Going back in time to early 1950.  I can remember watching Melvin mowing our lawn with a push mower, the old reel type made of solid iron, even the wheels were iron. The thing was very heavy and hard to push. Our house was on a double conner lot so there was a lot of grass to mow including the parkway on the south and west of the house. I watched as David took over for Melvin when he was old enough. All the time thinking “someday it will be my turn. “And low and behold not long after it was my turn Dad came home with a slightly used POWER MOWER!!!! It was still a reel type mower but had a Briggs & Stratton gas engine. It was self-propelled single speed controlled with a clutch lever if I needed to stop to remove a stick or rock caught in the reel. I could not believe my good luck. Melvin and David both said “yeah, now we get one.” I enjoyed mowing the lawn, it was great fun. I even started my own little lawn mowing business mowing some of the lawns in the neighborhood. Ahh, life was good at 603 North Liberty St.
