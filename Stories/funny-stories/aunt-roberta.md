# Aunt Roberta said, “Everyone in the Car!” (*This one is not funny*)

As I mentioned earlier, we used to sit outside on summer nights.  One evening we were all out in the side yard.  Mom was sitting in her lawn chair with Vern in her arms. Melvin, Dave and I were laying on a blanket spread out on the grass. Aunt Roberta sitting next to Mom.  It was a hot summer night, and the moon was bright, we were enjoying a nice summer evening together.  Dad was dealing craps at the club over the poolhall. Aunt Roberta had been up there for a while and borrowed Dad’s big black Buick to drive down for a visit.

We had been out there for a while when a man, who must have come up from N. Liberty Street, came through the side yard of our house, staggering around the conner of the house by the back porch growling and cursing incoherently wielding a large knife flashing in the moonlight. It all happened so suddenly that we all froze for a few seconds, scared stiff.

Aunt Roberta jumped up and said, “Everyone in the car”. The Buick was parked in our driveway next to the side yard. We all scrambled over, jumped in the car, locked the doors and Aunt Roberta backed the car out into our side road and turned up Liberty Street while the man with the knife chased us for a bit and then disappeared into the darkness.

Aunt Roberta drove up to the police office on Main Street and reported the incident.  The police followed us back home and searched the area, finding no one. I don’t know what the outcome was, no one was arrested.  I think that Dad found out the next day who this man was and put the fear of God into him. Anyway, we never had another incident like that again.  Once was enough. That was a night none of us would ever forget.
