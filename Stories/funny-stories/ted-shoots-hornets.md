# Ted shoots the hornets’ nest halfway across the bridge over center creek.

Ted and I decided one day to take his new 22 rifle which he got from his Grandfather Sarley, down to center creek and do some plinking.  Center Creek is about three miles North of town.  It runs East to West from Lakeside to Oronogo and continues West. The portion we usually went to was straight down Main St. or HY DD. There was a bridge over the creek at Oronogo which had a nice swimming hole, but we liked where it crossed Hy DD better since it was more direct and only about a one-hour walk. Plus, a nice tree right by the bridge with a rope we could swing out and drop in the river. Sometimes we could catch a ride, which was safe in those days. One day a guy picked us up on our way back to town after we had been swimming, there were four of us Me, Dick, Ted and Bud Youst.  Plus, a wet dog, Duke who was covered with mud. A guy pulled up to ask if we were going to town and said hoop in.   You won’t get this in today’s world. Back to Ted and I plinking. We had made it to the bridge over Center Creek which was about an hour walk from Ted’s house. Stopping along the way to pick off any target that presented itself. Old beer cans, whiskey bottles, anything along the road, except pop bottles, they were worth two cents each. Well, when we finally made it to the bridge, we were about halfway across when we stopped to look over the west side to see if we could spot a snake or turtle for a shot. I was leaning over the rail looking down when out of the conner of my eye, I saw ted taking aim at a huge Hornet’s nest in the Ironwork of the bridge.  I yelled “NO TED! DON’T SHOOT!”. At about the same time, he pulled the trigger, and a slew of angry hornets came pouring out of that nest and chased us all the way up the hill stinging us all the way. Looking at the picture of the bridge you can see that it’s a long haul up to the top of the hill, but we made it in record time.

*This is a recent photo, the bridge in our day looked a lot better Sixty years earlier. The bridge has been replaced and looks totally different now. I’m glad I got a picture before they replaced it. (Note, look for current pic)*
