# The penny box of matches

Dick Bauer and I had two cigarettes, which I had lifted from dad’s pack of Camel cigarettes on the nightstand next to the bed as he slept.  He worked nights and usually slept in.  I had watched my brother David do this several times and finally got enough nerve to do it myself. Dick and I planned to go down to the pig pin (abandoned) in the pasture at the end of Liberty Street and smoke them. Problem, we had no matches.  We were afraid to get some from the house for fear of getting caught (playing with matches called for a severe penalty).  Dick had a penny, so we decided to go up to May’s Grocery Store and buy a penny box of matches. We marched into the store trying to look as innocent as possible, stuck our noses over the counter and ask Mrs. May for a penny box of matches. Her usually very pleasant demeaner changed to a frown.  She leaned over the counter, looked us both square in the eye, and said, “What are you boys going to do with those matches”?  We froze.  We couldn’t think, we were doomed, trapped, guilty as hell, Busted!  How did she know?  We turned and ran out of the store. Then we sweated blood for a few hours before we had enough courage to go home thinking that Mrs. May had probably called our mothers. She had not, She and Mr. May were probably too busy laughing about it. From then on, any time we were in the store Mrs. May would smile and go on about her business. She was really a very nice lady, but we knew we weren’t going to get away with anything on her watch.
