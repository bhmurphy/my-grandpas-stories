# Melvin sleepwalks (*and paints he and David*)

Mom was painting our bedroom.  At that time there were three of us in the room.  Melvin and David slept together in a double bed, and I had a single across the room.  Vern was still out in the hallway in a crib.

Mom swore that Chemtone water-based paint was the best paint ever.  She bought it from Bradberry Bishops paint store next door to his Drugstore on the corner of Main and Dougherty Streets. Mom had done a lot of painting but had not finished so she cleaned the brush and put the lid on the paint can and left them in the room in the corner by Melvin and David’s double bed.

Some time that night Melvin got up, opened the paint can and proceeded to paint the bed (and Dave) while sound asleep.  I guess Dave was a heavy sleeper too because he didn’t know anything about it till Mom came in to wake us the next morning and saw what happened.  Dave and Melvin, the bedclothes, the floor, had paint all over them. Luckily, it was not oil- based paint.  I was safe on the other side of the room.  Dave said Melvin talked in his sleep too. For example, one-night Melvin said, “I need some fishhooks” Dave said what size? Number six. Do you need any sinkers? No. All the time sound asleep.
