# David sits on a hot stove.

For years we had only one bathroom with one sink, mirror and bathtub with no shower. The room was heated with a small white porcelain gas stove. One winter night, David had gone up for a bath and had been up there for a while when we heard a blood culturing scream.  Mom, Melvin and I ran up to the bathroom and found that David had sat down on the hot stove to dry off his feet. The stove was on, it had been on for some time. The stove was hot, extremely hot. David realized that the stove was hot, but it was too late.  He was branded. It was not funny at the time, but we all laughed about it many times later.
