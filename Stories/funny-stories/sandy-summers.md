# Sandy Summers knocks me out, Cold.

Sandy Summers lived on North Penn St. with her mom and Dad and her little sister Cindy. Sandy was one year behind me in School. But light years ahead of me scholastically. She was also a tom boy.  She would play tackle football in Dick Bauer’s side yard (right down the alley from her house) with us boys from Webster some of whom were two or three years older.  

I remember early in our friendship I think I was probably 5 or 6 years old which would make her 4 or5 years old.  One day we were playing out in her backyard.  She and her sister had a nice sand box and swing that her father, Charlie Summers, made for them.

One fine summer day I was over there playing with her.  I was on the swing having a great time.  I apparently had been on the swing for a time, and she asked me to get down because it was her turn. I said something like “I don’t have to get down and I’ll get down when I want to”. She said, “you better get down”. Again, I said, “I don’t have to get down”.  Whereupon She picked up a little toy (metal) rake and said again, “Get Down” I said “NO”.  She threw the rake and caught me right between the eyes. I saw a flash of light, I saw stars, I flew off the swing backwards and hit the ground out cold.  When I came too, I went home and told my Momma what happened.  She looked at me and said, “It’s a good thing she hit you in the head, you might have been hurt”.
