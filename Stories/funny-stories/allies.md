# Allies were COOL.

We kids, boys that is), in Webb city preferred allies over the streets in town.  We liked them because they were our main source of income.  We were always going through our neighbor’s trash looking for stuff of value.  Pop bottles were worth two cents each, and old lamps or toasters, anything electric because the cords were copper. We would burn the rubber off and coil it up till we had a few pounds and take it up to Ernie Burnes Junk Yard on North Main Street and sell it.  Lead was also high on our want list because it was plentiful.  At that time lead wad king.  Lead had many uses in the world, car batteries, gasoline, plumbing in our homes, paint, lead was used to build and repair auto bodies. This was before Bondo. I think we were getting 20 to 25 cents a pound for lead at that time.  Copper was and has always been more per pound, but it was not as plentiful as lead.   Aluminum and Brass brought a good price too, but again was hard to find also. Scrap iron was 1 cent a pound then and still is. Scrap iron was easy to find but was labor intensive.   For example, 10 pounds of lead brought two dollars and fifty cents. 100 pounds of scrap iron, one dollar. Tin at that time was like gold and hard to find.  So, when it was convenient, we would always take the alley rather than the main streets.

A funny story involving tin. Jerry Headgecorth and I had been working our way South on the alley between Main Street and Webb Street pulling our little red wagon along and loading it up with stuff as we went along.  We had made it all the way up town when we came upon a bin behind one of the buildings near the Larson movie theater.  The bin was filled with tin scraps.  What a bonanza! We were rich!  How could we possibly spend all the money we would get for all this tin? So, we dumped all the stuff we had collected up to that point to make room for our unbelievable bounty. The old lamp, a hubcap, six pop bottles, an old copper alarm clock, an extension cord, some lead pipe, a few lead wheel weights, all this had to go to make room for our…..did I say unbelievable bounty?

About that time a big man in overalls and a leather shop apron was standing at the door above the huge bin of tin looking down at us and ask.  “What do you boys think you are doing?”

Well, uh, you see uh, we uh. Isn’t this trash?  We ask. NO! it is not trash he answered. Now put that tin back and I’d better not see you two out here again. We did as he said, then reloaded our wagon with our trash and took off as fast as we could. Poorer, but wiser.
