# Vern drops Dad’s new rod and reel (*in Grand Lake*)

Dad’s half-brother Claud Bittner, his wife Thelma and their two boys Dan and Claud Jr. who lived in Galveston Texas would come up and visit us often.  Sometimes for a few days and sometimes for vacation.  Dad and Claud would rent a cabin at McDuffie’s resort on Lake of the Cherokees (Grand Lake) near Grove, Oklahoma.  A beautiful place high up on a bluff overlooking the lake. The boat dock was down some distance below the cabins.  Dad and Uncle Claud would rent boats and take Melvin, David, Dan and Claud JR, fishing.  Vern and I would stay behind and fish off the boat dock.  Vern had a cane fishing pole, and I had an old rod and reel a small tackle box with a few hooks, line, bobbers, and sinkers. One day Dad, Claud and the boys caught lots of fish and were busy cleaning them and getting ready for a big fish fry.  I am watching all this when Vern comes up from the dock and says to me, “Dad’s going to Kill Me”.  I asked him why? He said, “I dropped dad’s new rod and reel off the dock into the lake”. The water was 15 to 20 feet deep, so swimming down was not an option.  I had a big treble hook in my tackle box (I still have it).  I tied it on the line of my old rod and reel with the biggest sinker I had.  I lowered the hook down where Vern said he dropped dad’s brand-new rod and reel and gently pulled it across the bottom.  I felt something, I carefully reeled it up and much to my surprise and Vern’s relief there it was, dad’s new rod and reel. Whew, Vern would live.  We cleaned it off and dried it off as best we could and put it back in the boat. Vern stuck with his cane pole from then on.
