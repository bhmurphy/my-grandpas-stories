# Jimmie chops corn, *and his leg*

Dad had four boys. He believed we should be taught the value of hard work. We lived in town and there were not many opportunities for “hands on’ training around the house. Except for mowing the lawn (another story). So, he went and bought a 100-acre farm north of town for a training ground. He had other reasons for buying the farm but as far as we could see it was to keep us boys busy. I need to point out that Vern was too young for the training at the time. The farm came with a horse. A big black work horse almost as big as a Clydesdale with those same big hoofs. If he had a name, I can’t remember it. The main thing about this horse was he would not be ridden. He would pull a plow, a wagon and could probably pull a truck if need be. But he would not be ridden.  The first time Melvin and David led him over to a fence and got on him, he headed right to the nearest tree and scraped them off. After watching them get scraped off several times, I didn’t even try.

Dad hired a local farmer to plow and plant crops. The first was Strawberries, I can remember out there in the field pinching off some of the little flowers on the plants as they grew. To produce bigger berries, we were told.  We were ready to get back in school when summer was over. I think this was also part of Dad’s plan. We were happy to be back in school. Something happened and the strawberries, I don’t know what, too much rain, not enough rain? I don’t know but the dead plants were plowed under.
The next year peanuts were planted, and some were harvested. Prior to that I did not know that peanuts grew underground like potatoes. Dad brought a bushel home and Mom roasted them in the oven. They were very good to eat and were a good lesson in” the Fruits of our Labor.”

There was no barn on the farm. It had burnt down. The old house was full of hay. There was a small shed and stable across from the house. When Mom told Grandmother about it, she said “that would be a good place for a garden”. And it was. Mom planted Corn, Melon’s, Potatoes, green beans, and her favorite, red radishes. The old barn yard was some fertile ground. If it hadn’t been for Mom’s Garden, the farm wouldn’t have produced anything of value. Except the lesson on the “Value of work” for us boys.”

After the season was over, one day after school Mom said “it’s time to go out to the farm and clean up the garden and get ready for next season.  So, there we were, Mom, Melvin and David and me out on the farm cleaning up the garden.  Melvin and David were pulling weeds and I was chopping the corn stalks with a machete.  I laid some stalks to one side and cut right through them and into my left shin bone below my knee.  Pandemonium!  Mom grabbed me and put me in the Buick and left Melvin and David behind in a cloud of dust, on our way to Doc Slaughters’ office in Webb city. My leg hurt and I was bleeding but what scared me more than anything was Mom going over 100 MPH back to town. Doc Slaughter dressed my wound and stitched me up then gave me a shot, “so I would not get “Lock Jaw”. I did not get Lock Jaw. And I never knew anyone who did get lockjaw. But I know plenty of people who got a shot so they would not get it. I think all mothers in those days would warn their children not to step on any rusty nails while we were playing. Usually with no shoes in the summertime. The story went like this.” If you get lock jaw, you won’t be able to eat anything for two weeks. You will be on a liquid diet until it goes away.”

What about Melvin and David? We picked them up about halfway back to the farm, walking back home.
