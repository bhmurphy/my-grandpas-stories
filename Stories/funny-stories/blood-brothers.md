# Ted Sarley, Bud Youst and I, are Blood Brothers
We had just watched the movie “Broken Arrow” at the Civic Theater one Saturday afternoon. In the movie a cowboy and Indian Chief made peace after fighting for most of the movie. When they made peace with one another they took a knife and cut the palms of their hands, held them together and made a vow to become Blood Brothers.

Ted and I were neighbors. He lived right down the alley from my house. He was one year older than me, but we were in the same grade at Webester Elementary School because he missed his first year due to illness. We became very close friends, a friendship that lasted.

When we moved up to JR. High school, we made friends with new people who attended other Elementary Schools, like West Side, Eugene Fields, and Franklin. The Jr. High School occupied the entire first floor of the High School building. This is where we became friends with Bud Youst who lived in the 300 block of south Hall Street.

Do you think that kids can be influenced by a movie? Well Ted, Bud and I certainly were. After watching the movie, we decided we would become blood brothers. Lucky for us, none of us had our pocked knives that day.  But we did find a piece of broken glass and were able to cut our thumbs, hold them together and make our vow to be blood brothers for life. Crazy, Dumb? A little of both.
