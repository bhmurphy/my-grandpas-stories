# David burns down the Old Mule Stables

I was too young to remember anything about this incident but apparently 603 North Liberty was once a livery stable. (see Photo).  The large barn was replaced by a garage.  Along the wall on the North side were stalls for a dozen or so mules and horses. There were even two mules and one milk cow there when we moved in (so I was told). I was also told that the neighbor kids used to come over and ride the mules with Melvin and David. One day one of the boys fell off a mule and was dragged down the road, hurt bad. Dad got rid of the mules and the milk cow soon after. Now back to David, he was out there smoking in the stalls when somehow, they caught fire and burned down completely.   Dad later had a chicken house built in the Northeast corner of the wall. We had chickens for a few years and later got rid of them.  The chicken house later became the Black Hawk Club.
