# I Shoot Vern with my new BB Gun

It is Christmas morning 1953. A warm day for this time of year. I have my brand-new Red Rider BB gun loaded and ready to go.  Vern and I are outside beside the garage where Mom usually had her garden.  This is also the area surrounded by a rock wall, where we had a burn barrel for trash, leaves or whatever.  On this day Dad is using it to burn gift wrapping, boxes etc. from Christmas morning. He has gone inside for another load.  Vern is running around on the wall in his shorts.  Remember it is a warm day.  I call out to Vern, “Hey Vern play like you’re an Indian and I shoot you”.  I cock my brand new never fired Red Rider rifle and shoot.  And Vern screams. My God, I shot him in the Leg.  He falls off the wall holding his leg.  I hear something behind me.  I turn and its dad, with another load of wrapping paper. He put the papers in the burn Barrell turned facing me and held out his hand.  I walked over to him and placed my BB gun in his hand, he turned to the burn barrel, and threw my BB gun in and went back to the house. He never said a word, he didn’t have to. Dad believed that actions speak louder than words. He was so right.
