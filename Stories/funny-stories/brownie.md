# Brownie
Brownie, part German Sheppard, part kerr,she was our dog, and it was her job to protect the youngest child in the family. She took this job very seriously. She was my constant companion for six years until Vern was born. She would not let anything or anybody outside the family come near the youngest child. I remember one incident that was a close call for our neighbor, Mr. Dobbins He had come over to see how Dad was doing after suffering a heart attack.

We were all in the living room by the front door. Dad was in a small bed at the end of the room next to the stairway upstairs because he couldn’t make it up the stairs. Mom and Dad and Mr. Dobbins were all talking.

About that time Vern, who was not walking yet, came crawling up next to Mr. Dobbins, who reached down to pick him up and give him a hug. Brownie growled and went right for Mr. Dobbins, scaring the daylights out of all of us, not to mention poor Mr. Dobbins.

 Brownie did have few bad habits. One of which was almost fatal. She would chase cars that came up or down Liberty St. in front of our house.
One day she got hooked by the rear bumper of a car and had to have several stiches. Mom rushed her to the vet, or she would have died. She was also a cookie hound. If anyone even mentioned “cookie” she would come, running.

She was also gun shy. She would disappear Forth of July weekend and would not come home until all the noise was over. We never knew where she went, probably the chat piles at the end of Liberty St. She was a great dog and lived to be 14 Years old. We all cried when she died. It was a long time before we got another dog.
