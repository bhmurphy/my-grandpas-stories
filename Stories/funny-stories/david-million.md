# David accumulated one million dollars.

One million dollars, in play money that is. The kind you could buy at the dime store.  I forget how much it cost but a roll of play money contained an assortment of bills. Like two Ten $10,000 dollar bills, Five $5,000, ten $1000, ten $500, ten $100, twenty $50, one hundred $10, two hundred $5, and five hundred $1 dollar bills.  That adds up to $130,500.00. So, it would take almost seven rolls to equal one million dollars. Let us say a roll went for ten cents. Or seventy cents.  So, you have probably guessed.  It took several weeks or even Months to accumulate one million in play money.  Dave and I were millionaires at a very young age. Lots of fun.
