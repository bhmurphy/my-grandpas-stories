# Melvin and David Drop me (*like a hot potato*)

I had a roll of caps, you know, the kind for a kid’s cap pistol. It was not a full roll of ten individual rolls but four individual rolls.  Caps today don’t look like they did back in the 40’s and fifties.  The caps came packaged with ten attached together so you could pop off a roll at a time to load in your trusty Roy Rogers pistol and then you had maybe 50 shots. They were red in color and had little dots of black powder that would sound off loud and produce quite a bit of smoke.  We found out that if you put one roll on a flat surface and hit it with a hammer the whole roll would go off at one time and would be very loud and produce plenty of smoke.

So, there I was on my way upstairs to our bedroom with my four rolls of caps in my shirt pocket when I was confronted by my two older brothers, Melvin and David, who demanded I turn over the caps. I would not. They proceeded to take them from me. So now we are rolling around on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.  I could see that it was only a matter of time before they got them, so I tossed them in my mouth. Not a good idea. As soon as I did one of my dear brothers tackled me and I hit the floor with my chin and WHAM!  All four rolls went off at one time.  Fire and smoke came out of my nose and mouth.  Mom was coming in from the kitchen to find out what was going on, Melvin and David dropped me like a hot potato. My mouth hurt, my eyes hurt, my ears hurt.  I didn’t remember too much after that.  Mom took me up to see Dr. Slaughter right away and dealt with Melvin and David later. Doc said my mouth would heal up fast and it did. I could not hear a thing for a few days. I still have a big lump in my mouth under my tongue. The dentist told me it is a bone. I did get back to “normal” fast. And my two loving brothers were extremely nice to me for a few days.  But, that did not last long.
