# Dad loved to make a deal (*2 for one*)

David age 8 had tonsillitis, Jim age 5 did not have tonsillitis. So, we both ended up at Jane Chinn hospital to have our tonsils removed after Doc. Slaughter agreed to do both surgeries for the price of one. What I remember most about the ordeal was the weird hallucinations brought on by the Ether used to put me under. And the pain in recovery, not being able to swallow for quite some time after. David and I were in the same room. The nurse would only give us was a small cup of ice.  She said not to swallow, just let it melt in your mouth. Have you ever tried to do that? We were not in the hospital very long. We got to ride in the city ambulance on the way home. David asks the driver to turn on the Siren which he did, we thought that was great. We were on a liquid diet for a week or so, which wasn’t bad cause Mom would go up to Bradbury Bishops and get us a malt for lunch. David would call Doc Slaughter’s office every day and ask if we could eat solid food.  Finally, he said yes, eat anything you want… YEY! Bacon and eggs for breakfast. I sure am glad David never came down with appendicitis!
