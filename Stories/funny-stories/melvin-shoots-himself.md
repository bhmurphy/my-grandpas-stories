# Melvin shoots himself (*in the leg*)

After Melvin moved to Louisiana to work for Superior Oil Company. He purchased a Ruger Western style Single-Six 22 caliber pistol. Single-six means that the pistol had to be cocked by pulling the hammer all the way back before each shot and would hold six rounds in the cylinder of the gun. Two clicks on the hammer and the cylinder could be turned by hand to load or unload it. Two clicks were also the safety on the gun, in that position it could not be fired by pulling the trigger. He carried it in a western style holster. The holster has a leather loop that went over the hammer to keep the pistol secure in the holster. Also, there was a leather strap to tie the holster to your leg. Just like Matt Dillon or Bull Hitchcock used to do it.

Melvin and his friends had been fishing in the river. When they got back, Melvin bent down on his knee to tie down the boat, putting pressure on the strap over the hammer and shot himself in the calf of his right leg.  Bad design on the gun? You bet; all Ruger pistols of that model have been recalled adding a safety latch.  And owners who do not send their gun for the recall are encouraged to load only five rounds so the hammer will be on an empty cylinder when carried.  I spoke of Mat Dillon and Hitchcock earlier. That’s who Ralph Murff, one of Melvin’s friends in Louisiana was imitating with Melvin’s pistol, spinning it western style on his finger when he shot himself in the foot.  Melvin’s Ruger Single Six -pistol has two notches that we know of.
