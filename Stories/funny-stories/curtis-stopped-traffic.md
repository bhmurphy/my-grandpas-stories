# Curtis Stopped traffic on old Rt. 66

Curtis, who was my Brother Melvin’s classmate and good friend, spent a lot of time at our house. Curtis always said that Mom treated him like one of the family. He and Melvin spent hours and hours drawing pictures together with pen and ink. One day Curtis spilled his bottle of ink on the floor in the dining room where they were drawing.  Mom was not happy with him that day. The ink spot was very visible until mom had the carpet replaced, many years later. Melvin and Curtis were both exceptionally talented artists.  Curtis later did cartoons for the Sentinel newspaper for many years. Curtis also had quite a sense of humor.

Here’s what happened. It was quitting time at Webb Corp in Webb City.  Workers were on their way home to Carterville; Carthage all points East down Dougherty St. (Old Rt. 66) With normal traffic heading West into Webb City.

About halfway between Webb and Carterville where the old streetcar overpass for the railroad tracks running north and south cross the road.  People driving by noticed two individuals fighting up there on the overpass abutment on the East side which was roughly 40 ft. high.  One person seemed to have an advantage over the other. Cars started slowing to a crawl while observing what looked like two people locked in battel, a life-or-death knockdown struggle. Then suddenly one person was knocked to the ground, picked up and thrown over the end of the streetcar trestle down to the railroad tracks below. By this time traffic had stopped and people were honking their car horns and yelling, pointing in the direction of the altercation. BY the time the police arrived the person who threw the victim down to the tracks was long gone. An ambulance had also arrived but was not needed. The victim turned out to be a very lifelike dummy.
