# There was a coffee can on the fence post, the sign said, “50 Cents.”

Dad bought a used 1947 International Panel truck. I was about 9 years old at the time. At this point in time Dad loved to go fishing. I can remember fishing in the White River in South Missouri near Branson. This was before they dammed it up and created Table Rock Lake, which put Silver Dollar City and Branson on the Map. We would also spend an entire week on Lake of the Cherokees (Grand Lake) near Grove, Oklahoma. Dad’s half-brother and his wife and two boys would come up from Galveston, TX and we would all hang out together and have a great time. I remember one time we had a huge fish fry with the fish that they caught in one day.

I remember one summer weekend vividly. Dad loaded the old Green International truck with fishing gear and a cooler full of soda pop. Mom fried some chicken and potatoes and packed it in the old picnic basket with lots of other goodies.

Dad had heard of a farmer whose land backed up to the Buffalo River in Arkansas. He had built several picnic tables among the trees along the river. On an old dirt road across from the farmers house there was a gate and road leading down to the river. On a fencepost next to the gate was a coffee can with a note which said, “50 cents”.  All comers were on the honor system, that’s the way things worked in those days. So, we dropped a half dollar in the can, opened the gate drove through, closed the gate and made our way down to the river.

The river was beautiful. Crystal clear, cold water full of the biggest Brown Trout we had ever seen. The river was not too deep and had a sandy rocky bottom. Some of the rocks were Table rocks, large and flat.

David and Melvin wanted to get in the river right away. Dad said OK and they took off, after they changed into their bathing suits. I stayed behind and helped Mom unload the food and get a table set up.

Now Melvin and David were making their way up the river very slowly because there were lots of rocks on the bottom and kind of hard on their tender bare feet. After about 20 or 30 minutes they had made it some distance up the river when David felt something on this leg. He looked down and he and Melvin both had leaches attached to their legs. The thirty-minute trip up the river only took about five minutes on the way back.  Those boys were literally walking (running) on water. Dad, cool as usual, dipped a rag down the gas tank on the International and got the leaches off the boys in short order. Much to their relief (and Mom’s). The rest of the day was quite nice, and the food and soda pop were great.
