# The big Dime Store Jewelry Caper

Dick and I were starting to notice girls. Dick said that he really liked Joey Mare.  I did too but since he was my friend, I said that I liked Patsy McCullagh.

We decided that we should offer the girls a gift to win them over. But what kind of gift? And how long would it take to save enough money to buy a gift. We were about to give up and forget the whole thing when we took a wrong turn.  You know what they say, “Love Is Blind”. So, we decided to go up town to the Cress 5 & 10 cent store (AKA the Dime Store) and steal two rings from the Costume Jewelry Counter which was located on the South side of the store about midway up the aisle.

It was summertime and the store was not air-conditioned (it hadn’t been invented yet). They did have several Casablanca fans hanging down from the ceiling which helped but on most summer days they would leave the double doors on both sides of the store open.

We had a plan. We would go in and walk up to the jewelry counter and start looking at the rings which were displayed in a rack on the counter in little slots in the rack, right out in the open about midway in the store.

So, we strolled in the store looking as innocently as possible, stopping at the jewelry section and start looking at the rings. I think the most expensive ring was $1.50. Remember we are in the Dime store.

We both picked out a ring and slipped it in our pocket, then we slowly walked toward the door, the whole time feeling like there was this huge eye looking over our shoulder. We walked a little closer to the door then Dick said in a loud voice “Look! There goes Ted” and we ran out the door and down Main Street.

Dick and I soon realized that crime could get extremely complicated.  The first thing that occurred to us was that once we gave the rings to the girls the question would be ask “wow! How did you get enough money to buy these rings?” And …. Word would surely get back to our mothers and we would have to explain where the rings came from.

So, we devised another plan. The whole time feeling that huge eye in the sky watching every move we made. The plan went like this. We would plant the rings in the road (a gravel road) next to my house, then pretend that we found them there. So far so good. We planted the rings and covered them with a little gravel. We planned to be seen finding the rings in the road. Before we could act out our half-baked plan, a car came by and almost ran over them, much to our surprise. We had not expected that. We finally realized that we were digging a hole that we might never get out of if we kept going.” It just kept getting deeper and deeper.

We finally came to our senses and retrieved the rings, cleaned them up, and returned them to the Dime Store in the same way we had lifted them. How we got them out of the store and back in without being detected is a mystery.

Ahhhh! That felt great, the weight of the world was lifted off our shoulders.  At last, we had a clear conscience.  No girlfriends, but a clear conscience.
That night as we were listening to the radio show “Crime Busters” we looked at each other and shook our heads in agreement when the announcer said **“Remember, Crime Does Not Pay!”**
