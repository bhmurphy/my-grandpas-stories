# Dummies

Melvin and David got exceptionally good at making dummies.  

Every year they made one for Halloween to sit out on the front porch to greet the trick or treaters.   They had a Scary looking head with a face craved in it made from a Coconut that hadn’t been shelled. Dad bought it for David when we were in Galveston Texas to visit Aunt Thelma and Uncle Claude and our cousins, Claude Jr. and Dan Murphy Bittner.

They would dress him up and sit him in a rocking chair on the front porch ready to greet the kids.  They also used him for the “Scare House” in our basement which they would charge admission to see around that time of year.  The kids from Webster Elementary loved it. Our basement by itself was scary enough but the Dummy, shrunken head, and Melvin roaming around dragging a chain playing Frankenstein scared the daylights out of some. I don’t know where the shrunken head came from, but it was very realistic, in fact we thought it was real for a time, but Dad told us it really wasn’t, but it did have real hair.

The dummy was used two other times that I remember.  The first time was the night Melvin tied a rope around the dummy and lowered it out of our bedroom upstairs which was over the dining room downstairs.  David was sitting at the dinner table with his back to the window playing solitaire (the old way, with a deck of cards).  It was nighttime and dark out. Melvin, knowing where David was, lowered the dummy down to the window and thumped it.  David saw it out of the corner of his eye, threw the cards in the air and ran upstairs yelling.  We thought it was very funny, David did not.

Another time Melvin and David thought it would be funny to tie the dummy from a rafter in the garage.  This turned out to be an awfully bad idea.  Dad coming in late one night almost had a heart attack for real when he pulled in the garage and saw it hanging there thinking it was one of us boys.  He didn’t forbid us from playing with the dummy, but he did say “I better not ever catch you boys playing with a rope again, ever!”
