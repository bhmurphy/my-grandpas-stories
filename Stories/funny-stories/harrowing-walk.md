# The Harrowing walk home from the Civic Theater
## *There we were, walking down the middle of the tree lined Liberty Street, at night in the dark*

I have many fond memories of Saturdays at the movies in Webb city.  I remember we had three theaters to choose from.  The Junior, and  Larson both on main street right across from each other and the Civic on Dougherty Street between web and liberty streets across from the post office.

As I remember it the Junior was the low budget theater with the Larson kind of the middle of the road and the Civic the plushest and the largest of the three.  We weren’t there for the surroundings though but the movies, popcorn, soft drinks, and candy.  Especially those little wax pistols, red lips, moustaches, or soda bottles filled with juice.
A typical Saturday afternoon at the movies would include two feature films, usually a western starring Roy Rogers, Gene Autry or Hop along Cassidy. Sometimes it would be Jungle Jim or Tarzan.  Sandwiched in between the feature films would be intermission, a newsreel, one or two cartoons, and an action serial like “Rocked Man”, “Lash LaRue” or “Zorro” to name a few. And we had to set through coming attractions or previews.  Our parents could get rid of us for a whole afternoon for a quarter each, what a deal.

A kid could easily kill a whole day at the movies.  Especially if he or she chose to watch the whole thing twice!  Which you could do in those days, they didn’t turn on the lights and run everyone out like they do today. And you could come in at any time and stay till you got to the point in the movie where you came in, and then go home or stay longer.

Well, stay longer is exactly what Dick Bauer and I did one winter Saturday afternoon at the Civic theater.  In fact, we stayed so long it was dark when we left for home. Normally this would not have been too much of a problem as we both lived on North Liberty Street about five blocks away. The trouble was that the feature films that day were “Frankenstein meets Dracula “and “Wolfman”.

There we were walking down the tree lined street, at night, in the dark, imagining Frankenstein, Dracula or Wolfman behind every tree, in every shadow ready to lurch out and grab us at any moment…. And we had no protection, we had already eaten our wax guns! Clearly the five blocks may as well have been five miles, but we ran it in record time, right down the middle of the street, our hair standing on end, white as a couple of ghosts. When we got home, We both caught a lot of flak from our moms for being late for supper but that was OK, we were home safe and sound. That was a day at the movies we will never forget.
