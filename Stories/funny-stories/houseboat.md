# The Houseboat

Dad bought a Houseboat on Spring River at Riverton, Kansas. I guess he bought it, he may have won it at the crap game, or taken it as payment of a gambling debt. There were several houseboats in that section of the river below the bridge at Riverside Inn on old Route 66, a popular restaurant at that time. Mom loved to go over there for lunch after Church. Back to the houseboat. It was much like most of the other houseboats along the river. About 12 ft long and 6ft wide with an open deck on one end for fishing. Inside a dry sink and counter for cleaning fish. A small kitchen table, a two-foot square hatch in the floor in the center with a latch which could be lifted exposing the river below, which came in handy since there was no bathroom. The interesting thing about the area was the access gate. Apparently, the owners of the string of houseboats along the riverbank had to pay a fee to park their boat. The chain holding the gate shut was made up by several padlocks linked together. It could take a while to find your padlock to open the gate, since they all looked alike. After Dad died Mom ask Uncle Mars to drive me over to the Houseboat to check on it. Which he did. I was surprised, to say the least, that he cussed like a Sailor all the way over there and all the way back.  What we found was not good, the Houseboat was sinking. The only thing keeping it afloat were the moorings alongside the riverbank. Two- or three of the 55-gallon drums keeping it afloat had taken on water and were not floating the boat. I do not remember what became of it. Perhaps Mom was able to sell (or give it away).
