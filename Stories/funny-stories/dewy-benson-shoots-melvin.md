# Dewy Benson shoots Melvin (*Accidently?*)

Melvin and Dewy had gone hunting one winter day. It was cold that day and Melvin was wearing the old Bomber Jacket that Dad had bought at the Army Surplus store. Melvin had his Sweet 16-gage pump shotgun, and Dewey his 22-Lever Action rifle. They were hunting whatever presented itself.  Melvin liked to go out to Center Creek where there were usually a lot of crows. Crows are very smart, and it was hard to get close enough to bag one.

The story went like this. They were crossing a barbed wire fence and had propped their guns on the fence wire. Dewy had climbed over and Melvin was on his way over when the 22 went off and shot Melvin in the arm.  The bullet went up his arm from the wrist to the back of his shoulder and lodged there.  It probably would have gone all the way through but for the heavy leather sheep lined bomber jacket Melvin was wearing.  Doc Slaughter was able to extract the bullet in his office since it was just under the skin.  He said it was a miracle that it traveled the length of his arm without hitting any Bone, Ligaments, arteries or blood vessels.

Years later I ask Melvin, “What really happened that day.” Melvin said that on the way back from the creek Dewy pointed the rifle at him and said “Hey Murph” Melvin put of his hand and said NO DEWY! Too late, Dewy who thought the gun was empty, pulled the trigger and shot him. Melvin didn’t want Dewy to get into trouble, so they made up the story. Always assume that the gun is loaded. Never point it at anyone or anything you don’t want to shoot.
