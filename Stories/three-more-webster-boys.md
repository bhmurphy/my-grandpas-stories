# Three More Webster Boys.

Teddy, Louie and Jimmie

Mr. and Mrs. Riggs lived on the NW conner of Webb and Vine streets directly across from the Webster Elementary School playground. There was an alley between their house and Main street which ran from Dougherty Street North all the way down and dead ended on Vine. Mr. Riggs could often be seen in his backyard chopping and splitting wood. They had no electricity or plumbing in their house.  They used kerosene lamps for lighting and a wood burning cook stove for and cooking and heating in the winter. People in town who knew their situation would bring wood from broken tree limbs or trees that were cut down to their house.

There was a telephone pole on the conner in front of their house with a guy wire or cable to support the pole.  No telephone wires were attached to the pole since they had no phone in their house.

When school ended for the day kids would come streaming out of the schoolhouse heading home. Some would go up main street south, Across Main street east, cross over vine to Webb Street, or head West on vine to their homes. To say the least, the intersection of Web and Vine streets was verry congested during that time.

Here is what happened. Teddy who lived on Web Street directly across the street from Mr. and Mrs. Riggs, and Louie who lived one block South at the conner of Web and Arch and Jimmie who lived across the alley form Louie’s house on Liberty Street had made it a custom to swing on and or hang onto the guy cable supporting the telephone pole in front of the Riggs house each day after school.  Over time, the cable began to sag so they began to swing the cable round and round causing the pole to sway back and forth.  One fateful day While Teddy was swinging the cable round and round, Jimmie and Louie began to push on the pole back and forth causing the top of the pole to rock back and forth.  Meanwhile there were kids still crossing the street. Suddenly, and much to the surprise of the three Webster boys, the pole snapped and came crashing down across the intersection with a loud thunder pulling the guy cable out of the ground like a 30-foot-long whip which made a buzzing sound as it passed by.

Mrs. Riggs came running out of her house and said, “I knew this was going to happen.” About the same time Judy H who was the teacher’s pet and always told on people in school, came running up, pointing at the three Webster boys, and said “THEY DID IT!”

Thank God no one was hurt, not even a scratch. No one was hit by the pole or the cable which whizzed across the intersection. It truly was a miracle.

Pretty soon the Telephone man came down to look the situation over. He kind of grinned and said, “did you boys really do this?” The three Webster boys admitted guilt (had too, there were plenty of witnesses) still in shock and thankful that they were not going to jail for murder. Then the Telephone man said, “well we should have removed that pole a long time ago, you boys did a good job! Thanks.”
