# 603 N Liberty

![603 North Liberty, 1890](../assets/images/603-n-liberty/before-the-horseless-carriage.jpg)

This is what 603 North Liberty looked like about 53 years before we moved there from Arkansascity  Kansas where I was born. You can see the house in the background looking West. Someone gave my mother this same photo which had been colored.  I‘ll post it if I can find it. By the time the Murphy family moved into this house the old barn in the photo was gone and there was a two-car garage in its place, about three car lengths from the street to the garage. Next to the garage on the East side there was a loading ramp was probably used to load or unload livestock to or from the stables located behind the garage on the North side.   And some time along the way the livestock were Missouri Mules which had become quite popular. The house had been improved with cement walkways to the side porch and front porches. The porches were constructed with stone from the lead and zinc mines in the area.  The columns on the porches were very large, about four feet square. This made the house look very imposing Sitting up there on that raised lot on a high foundation. In fact, it was a two-bedroom one bath on the upper level a living room, dining room and kitchen on the lower level. It did have a full basement where mom’s ringer washer, the water heater and furnace were located. Another room where a spare gas range used for canning and a place for Melvin to melt lead for his sinker mold and the gas meter were located. A third room was mostly storage space. A heavy wooden door in the hallway between the rooms led to the storm shelter which was under the front porch. This was used mostly during storms but also served as David’s Chemistry Laboratory where he and Vernie Barrow spent a lot of time experimenting on various projects. I may have mentioned earlier, they were making pipe bombs down there. The first one they tested out behind the garage shook the house and Mom let them know right away. NO MORE PIPE BOMBS!

The old homeplace as it looks today. The new owners closed in the  side porch for some reason. I planted that big oak tree on the right sideof the front yard. A squerrel had burried an acorn in the side yard close to the garage. I dug it up and moved it to the front yard where an elm tree stood for years but had died before when a virus came through the area and killed most of the elm trees in town. As a metter of fack, streets throughout the city were lined with big elm trees. It was a beautiful sight.

Mom would have been a child during that time. It must have been terrible. Grandmother talked about it a lot. Very few people had jobs, so the WPA was formed to keep men busy while wives and kids kept up the Homefront. Gardens were a necessity, not a luxury. Grandmother said that if it wasn’t for FDR the country wouldn’t have survived. Many people felt the same way, I’m sure that’s why he was re-elected twice, but died during his third term.   Back to 603 N. Liberty. I mentioned the old stable area earlier. The only thing remaining when we moved in was the foundation for the barn and stables. The house is on a double lot with the front facing Liberty St. and Arch Street on the South side and the alley between Liberty and Webb Street behind the house on the East side. The garage and old stable area took up one quarter of the double lot. There were 12 stables for mules or horses all along the North side of the wall. A loading ramp on the East side of the garage for loading and unloading livestock. Two mules and a milk cow came with the house. The mules had to go after one of the neighbor kids fell off one while racing down Arch Street, which at that time was dirt and gravel. The boy held onto the rope around the mule’s neck and was dragged.  After Mom explained to Dad that she really didn’t have time to milk the cow, he gave the cow to the Salvation Army. Sometime after that the stables caught fire and burned down.

In this early photo of my two brothers and our dog Brownie, you can see the Wall that surrounded the old stable yard in the background looking east from our side yard. Must have been late 1943 or early 1944. You can see the garage in the left side of the photo. It looks like wintertime, at least Melvin and I are dressed for it. I was probably 7 or8 months old at the time. The houses in the background East of us were on N. Webb Street they all had access to their home from the alley behind us. Everyone parked their car in a garage behind their house. The Dog is Brownie. Her job was to protect the youngest child in the family. She took her job seriously; she wouldn’t even let a chicken come near us.
