# Chapter Seven *The Game, Upstairs*

One venture that did happen was the “Game” over the pool hall, Webb City. I’d like to insert an article I wrote for the book “Families & History of Webb City Carterville and Oronogo” which describes the pool hall and the “Game” upstairs. The photo is Les Ulmer holding hid God Don, James Lester Murphy, age 7 months.

Webb City Recreation or the “pool hall” as it was commonly known, was at 110 W. Daugherty St. in Webb City.  The pool hall was owned and operated from 1944 to 1971 by Lester “Les” Ulmer, my godfather.  My father Dan Murphy was an Irish catholic and as was the custom in the days when my three brothers and I were born, we all had godfathers.  None of us were christened by the church, mainly because my mother was a Baptist and would have none of that.   We were, however, all named after our godfathers.  Melvin the oldest was named after Melvin Lee Macy (Melvin Lee Murphy), Dave after David Allen (David Allen Murphy), Vern after Vern Wilder (Vern Eugene Murphy) and I was named after Les Ulmer (James Lester Murphy).  As it was explained to me when I was old enough to understand it was an honor for the godparent to have a child named after them and if anything, ever happened to Mom and Dad our godparents would take us to raise as their own.  That need never arose I’m happy to say.  Had it arisen though I don’t think I could have asked for better godparents than Les and his wife Bea Ulmer.  Les and my father were both born in Webb City, lived there all of their lives and were lifelong friends and business partners for a time.

I’d like to describe the pool hall as best I can.  My recollection of the pool hall would be from the 1950’s and 60’s.  Located across the alley (West) from Merchants and Miners Bank, next to Webb City Hardware and directly across the street form Johnson’s Feed Store, the pool hall was home away from home for many a young man in Webb City.  I’m sure there was a minimum age for admittance.  I can’t recall what that age was but I think it was thirteen years old.  I guess girls were allowed but I don’t remember ever seeing one in there, girls just weren’t attracted to pinball machines and pool tables.

I can still picture in my mind’s eye the layout of the place.  The front door was on the North West corner of the building.  The hall was one big room about 25 by 60 ft.  As you came in the door on your right were three pinball machines, further down the wall was a big wooden couch with red leather upholstery.   On your left (East wall) there was a big wood and glass counter.  Behind the counter stood a very large Ardmore with a big mirror in the middle.  The Ardmore housed all the tobacco products, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco etc.  The counters were full of all kinds of good stuff, candy, chips, peanuts and boxes of assorted chocolates.  On top of the counter were the punchboards.  The punchboards were for adults only.  For a dime apiece or three for a quarter you could punch out little pieces of paper, if you were lucky and punched out the right one you won  a box of chocolates.  My dad used to bring home boxes of candy from time to time. Behind you against the North wall between the door and counter were a coke machine and an ice crème chest; you could purchase a pint of ice crème for twenty cents, pop sickles for five cents. Cokes were five cents, no deposit, no return.

The pool tables were lined up in a row down the center of the room from side to side from about where the wooden couch with the red leather upholstery stood to the south end of the room.  The first table on the north end was a billiard table (no pockets just three balls) the next table was a snooker table (big table with small balls and pockets).  The rest were regulation eight ball tables, about six or eight of them.

On the west wall overlooking the pool tables were a row of chrome chairs with red plastic upholstery where one could sit and watch your opponent run the table, or just sit and watch others play if you were short of cash. The walls were a light green color from the floor up to about four feet and a crème color up to the ceiling. There was a thin film of nicotine on the walls because the room was always filled with smoke. One really didn’t need to smoke in there, all he had to do was breathe. 
On the East wall were the cue racks, they were kind of a lazy Susan circular rack of about 10 cues each. At the end of the room was a small bathroom which was built into the Southeast corner of the room. There was a door next to the bathroom which led into the back room. It was always locked. Over in the Southwest conner there were four domino tables. Each conner of the table had a little square of flat black paint which were for keeping score with chalk. I can remember some very lively domino games going on back there. Every so often an argument would break out about who played the wrong domino.  They may have been playing for money. I have no idea what it cost to play dominos, but I think they charged per game.

Speaking of money, I forgot to mention it cost five cents per game for eight ball, and a one cent per minute for billiards or snooker. The loser paid. Since eight ball was” by the game” that was the most popular. When the game ended, you yelled,” RACK!” and one of the employees would come, rack the balls, collect a nickel and you were ready to go again. We played for money sometimes but mostly for fun.  I don’t remember any pool sharks around the pool hall. Some of us thought we were but only in our dreams.

Real money games were played upstairs. If you were known by the doorman and admitted access to the backroom and upstairs where you could play the slot machines, shoot craps or play poker or blackjack. The room was kind of dark but nice and almost as big as the downstairs room. There were several slot machines, one crap table, one poker table and one blackjack table. There was also a small lounge area, well-furnished and offered free drinks and food for the customers. Les and my dad were partners, and the “Game” was highly successful for several years.  Dad died in the summer of 1959 at the age of 47 after a long illness, sorosis of the liver, which ended the partnership. The game did not last very long after that. My brother David had a short career as a craps dealer for a while, but Mom put a stop to that when she found out. I had a photo of him at the table dealing but I don’t know what happened to it.

Les continued to own and operate the pool hall for many years. One Wednesday afternoon in 1971, Les went upstairs where he had his office to get a newspaper. On the way up he fell and suffered injuries to the head which resulted in a blood clot on the brain.

He died the next day a St. John’s Hospital in Springfield after undergoing surgery to remove the clot. His wife Bea sold out shortly after and Webb City Recreation was no more.
