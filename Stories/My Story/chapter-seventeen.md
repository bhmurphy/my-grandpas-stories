# Chapter Seventeen  Listening to the Radio

Back when I was growing up in Webb City in the 40’s and 50’s very few people had a Televisión. There were only three broadcasters nationwide, NBC, CBS, and ABC. In our area we only had two. One station in Joplin and One in Pittsburg Kansas. And they only broadcast a few hours a day. So, TV was not a big deal, but everyone listened to the radio. Programs like Drama, Police, Detective, Suspense, Westerns, Comedy, Sports and even Educational, music and of course the News. Soap Operas during the day were immensely popular with the housewives. One Man’s Family, Just Plain Bill, Lorenzo Jones, Vick and Sade, and Lum & Abner to name a few were popular shows. I’ll never forget the theme song for Lorenzo Jones, Mom must have listened to that show for years before I was old enough to go to school. It’s still instilled in my mind. I know she liked Lum & Abner too because some of her favorite sayings were from them, “I’m wore to a frazzle, wore to a frazzle” and “Bless your little Heart”. My favorite show was The Lone Ranger. I think I liked the music more than the action.

We had a 1942 Philco combination AM Short Wave Floor model Radio with a Record player which played the 78 rpm “Plater” records. I remember Mom playing the Ink Spots record over and over.  “We Three” on one side and “To Each His Own” on the flip side. My two brothers and I would lay on the floor evenings listening to some of the programs like, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Life of Riley, Life with Luigi, Amos and Andy, Gang Busters (David’s favorite) and The Inner Sanctum (Melvin’s favorite) that squeaking door at the beginning of the program was scary enough, but the host of the show was worse. This was one of the latest programs of the night, right before bedtime. Talk about nightmares.

that one scared me to death, so did The Shadow. Sunday Night at 7pm was always The Jack Benny Show, then it was time for bed and School the next morning. Below is a recent photo of the same Philco radio that we had in our living room in Webb City.  Why do I have it today? The story goes like this. When we finally got a television very late in the 1950’s, my dad gave this radio to our Uncle Elmer who was still very interested in radio. This was soon after they had gotten electricity to their home out on the farm. Prior to that he and Aunt Emma had a battery-operated radio. They used the Philco for several years then stored it out in the shed behind their house years later when they got a TV. My brother David who was living in Texas at the time stopped by to see them while he and his family were visiting Mom. He went out to the farm and ask if they still had the radio. It was out in the shed and in amazingly good condition. David took it back to Texas and kept it for years. Later he gave it to Vern who was also living in Texas at the time. When Vern moved back to Webb City, he brought the radio with him, and he and his wife Shirley kept it in their new home in Dueweg East of Joplin. After Vern died, his wife Shirley ask if I would like to have the radio. Of course, I was delighted and brought it back to my home in Fredericksburg VA where it graced our living room for years. When Kathy and I moved to NC the radio came with us. It is still in good condition even at 80 years old. The buttons on top are used to select Short Wave stations, AM radio or the Record player. The knobs for tuning and volume control. I can remember laying on the floor as a child listening to Charles Dickens’ classic “A Christmas Carol” on Christmas Eve. It was very scarry for a child but had a very happy ending.

Dad told us kids a story about a radio program which caused a panic. It was The Mercury Theater presentation of “The War of The Worlds”. It was about the world being invaded by Martians whose spaceship had landed near Groves Mill, NJ.  The show was so realistic that listeners, especially people who tuned in late thought they were listening to a live news broadcast. This caused a wave of mass hysteria throughout the nation between the hours of 8:15 and 9:30 pm on October 30,1938.
The next morning the newspaper headlines read “Nation in panic from Martian broadcast”. Dad and Mom were in their Twenties at the time, and they remembered it well.

Later in life I listened to it on “The Big Broadcast” with Ed Walker who was a living encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio history. He would broadcast from WAMU 88.5FM, Washington DC from every Sunday evening from 7pm to 10pm. When he added “The War of The Worlds” program during his show one night.  After listening, I remembered what my dad had told me about it. And I could easily understand how it was mistaken by so many as a real news broadcast. It was a first-class production and very realistic.

I got hooked on Ed’s show and would try to listen to it every Sunday night. I couldn’t stay up till 10 PM so I taped the last hour on my cassette tape recorder (remember those?). Later I moved up to a HI-FI VCR recorder, which I could use to record all four hours of ED’’s Big Broadcast. No picture, just sound.  Just one problem. This was FM Radio, so when a storm came through and caused a lot of static, I couldn’t do anything about that. Lucky it didn’t happen that often. I got so hooked on the show that I put a timer on my FM Tuner and programed my VCR to tape the show even when I was on Vacation. Another thing I could do was transfer my favorite shows from VCR to Cassette and listen to them while I traveled to and from work every day. I got pretty good at editing the show and recording just the parts I really liked. I have shoe boxes full of old cassettes from the 1990’s and VCR tapes up to 2006 or so when I started recording off the internet to my computer and transferring to DVD’s. Of course, I transferred all my VCR tapes to DVD. Now I have shoeboxes full of those. Later Ed Walker died, and another fellow took over. I guess there were so many listeners who loved Ed so much that it just wasn’t the same and the show ended. I still enjoy listening to Ed and hope someday my children and grandchildren will do the same.
