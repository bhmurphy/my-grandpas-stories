# *Chapter Therteen the Blackhawk Club*

Let us go back in time to around mid-1953. In History class at Webster Elementary School, we learned about the Black Hawk War in 1832. My friends and classmates were impressed by the bravery of the Sauk Indian tribe who went up against the US Militia which outnumbered them by more than ten to one. They were led by their chief, Black Hawk.

That same year we learned about the Civil War between the States 1861.  We were impressed with the bravery and tenacity of the Southern Army who were able to win many battles, even though they were out-numbered and out-gunned by the Union Army.  Our sympathies were with the Confederates and the Sauk’s, so when we formed a club, we named it The Blackhawk Club.

It took Dick Bauer, Louie House and me several days to clean out the old chicken house Behind the garage at 603 North Liberty St.  It was in the Northeast corner of what was left of the old Mule Barn and Stable foundation which was a rock wall about 18 inches thick and over six feet tall, therefore our clubhouse was a mighty fortress.  The stables were burned down several years earlier and Dad had the chicken house built sometime later. It was a single room building about 8X10 with a concrete slab floor, one window and a door at the corner. We had an old kerosene stove for heat and a kerosene lamp for lighting, which we seldom needed because we never met a night.  The charter members were Jim Murphy President, Gary King Vice President, Dick Bauer Treasurer, Louie House Librarian, Joe Simpson Sgt. of Arms and Spy, Teddy Sarley Secretary.  And members Bobby Reid and Mike May.

About that same time Jim Burk and Jack Lassiter formed their own club and named it The Blue Hawk club.  And they announced that their sympathies were with the Union Army of 1861 and that they were in opposition to the Black Hawk club. Trouble was brewing at Webster Elementary. Their members were Jim Burk President, Jack Lassiter Vice President, Lonnie Sharp, Johnny Lightner, Wendel Woolsey, and Joe Simpson…. Yes Joe Simpson, spy. Joe was a Double Agent and neither side ever knew who he was for or against.

Our clubs were nothing like the gangs of today, mainly we would have our meetings, make plans, just hang out. We even had a play after school one day. It was a mixture of Huk Fin and Tobacco Road.  We used the old double barrel Cap and ball civil war era rifle that Mr. Dobbins, my next-door neighbor gave me.  We would cut up some caps and stuff them in the hammers of the gun and it sounded like a real gun.  We invited the kids in the hood and Mom popped some popcorn and passed it out. Everyone seemed to enjoy the play and I’m sure they liked the popcorn and cool aide.

The two clubs got along well for a while until one day we Black Hawks decided to build a bridge across a little dry creek near the chat pile at the end of Liberty St. There was an open field about five acres in size with a barn facing Arch St. and two old pig pins close to the creek. This lot was rented out to folks from time to time, for example one of our neighbors up Liberty St. had two goats down there.  And Dick’s Dad rented it one time to raise some pigs.  But now no one was renting, and we could come and go, no problem.  So, we Black Hawks built the bridge.  It was not much, built with any old lumber we found lying around. It took a week or more to finally get it built. The bridge did not look too good, it was kind of shabby, but it came in handy after a rain when the dry creek became a roaring river, for a while, that is. The bridge was not even a month old when it was destroyed, broken to pieces. We had been attacked.

Our spy, Joe Simpson informed us that the Blue Hawk club was responsible. Retaliation was in order.  We knew their clubhouse was in Jim Burk’s backyard in a shed next to the alley between North Pennsylvania and Ball streets. Joe attended meetings there and gave us the layout of the inside of the clubhouse. The building was small and narrow, with a door on one end and a window on the other end.  The door was always padlocked and the window, which was made from planks of wood, no glass, and was secured by clothes hanger wire in the latch.

Dick Bauer lived at the corner of North Liberty and West Arch, Jim Burk lived on the corner of W. Arch and N. Roane, less than two blocks West of Dicks house. Dick and I waited for a dark night, no full moon and lots of cloud cover, to sneak over to the Blue Hawk clubhouse. Our plan was to break into the club house and mess it up. By Friday night the weather was exactly right, very dark. We crept down Arch Street to the clubhouse, trying to be as quiet as possible. I was able to pull the bottom of that old wooden window so that Dick could reach inside and unwind the hanger wire from the latch. The window swung open, and we climbed in, ransacked the place and made our getaway. Mission accomplished, Tit for Tat and that’s that. Or so we thought, Stay Tuned.

A few days later while we were in our clubhouse having a meeting, we were attacked by the Blue Hawks throwing rocks at our clubhouse. I could see out our window that some of the rocks were flying over our clubhouse and falling dangerously close to Mom and Dad’s cars parked in the driveway. Whereupon we grabbed our BB Guns and chased them down the alley.

The whole thing didn’t last more than 20 minutes. Later both sides decided to call a truce before things really got out of hand and someone got seriously hurt.
The Blackhawk Club continued to meet, take on new members and plan swimming, fishing, or hunting trips especially in the summer months. After we moved up to Jr. High School from Webster Elementary, we met and made new friends from the other schools in town like West Side, Eugene Field and Franklin. Of course, we already knew some of these kids because we went to church together. In my case Cecil Goddard, Jim Dawson and Jerry Baldwin were all in my Sunday School Class at First Baptist.

In the meantime, Dad had bought two Thoroughbred dogs. Weimaraners, a male and female, Duke and Daisy. His plan was to breed them and sell the puppies. You guessed it. The Clubhouse became the Doghouse. We moved to good-sized room in the basement of our house in the Southeast corner of the basement. With a window looking out to the side yard and Arch Street on the south side of the house. We welcomed some of our newfound friends to the club. Charlie Smith and his older Brother, and Thomas Hattery, to name a few.

By the time we reached High School we had plenty of extra-curricular activities, and some had after school jobs.  So, the Blackhawk Club was no more.
