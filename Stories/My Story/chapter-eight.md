# Chapter Eight, *Growing up in Webb City Missouri*

My earliest memory at four years old was meeting my lifelong friend and neighbor Richard Neal Bauer. The time would be early  summer, 1947. I was out in front of the house when I spotted a bobtail truck down Liberty Street at the end of the block and on the other side of the street. There were men unloading furniture while a young boy stood by watching. I rode down there on my little tricycle and ask the boy “what’s your name?”  Dick, he said then asked my name, Jimmie I said. Then he asks me “how old are You” I said I’m four to which he replied, “you can’t be four, I’m four”. The beginning of a lifelong friendship which ended at 2AM July 1, 2018, when Dick passed away due to cancer. His Son David at his side, ending 71 years of a great friendship.  Dick, I really miss you.

Growing up in Webb City during the 40s and 50s was a great experience. I think being in the Mid-West, where people are down to earth, plain spoken, honest, God-fearing folks where a handshake was as good as any legal document, had a lot to do with it. Dick once said, “We grew up at just the right place and at the right time”. He was right on.

The first 18 ½ years of my life were spent at 603 N. Liberty St. Webb City, MO.  Some of my readers will have a memory of the house, most do not. Let me start with a bit of history of the old homeplace which at one time in the late 1800’s was a Livery Stable and Mule Barn.

I am told that when we first moved in, there were two mules and one cow there in the stable area. Apparently one of Melvin’s fiends was dragged down Arch St. which was a gravel road at that time. He was riding bare back, fell off and held on to the rope around the mule’s neck and was badly hurt. The mules were sold. Mom said we already have three mules, Melvin, David and Jimmie. Later the cow was given to the Salvation Army. Mom said she didn’t have time to milk the thing.  The barn in the picture was long gone by the time we moved in, and several changes had been made to the house. This is how the house looked when we lived there in the 40’s,50’s and 60’s.603 N. Liberty St., looking NW from Ayler St.

The two-story house with a full basement, which is on a double lot had a big footprint and was built on a hill, so it was kind of imposing from the street level. It was not that big really.  With a living room, dining room and kitchen on the first floor and two bedrooms and one bath upstairs. Mom and Dad in one BR, Melvin & David in a double bed and I had a single bed for six years until Vern was born.  He slept out in the hallway until he was old enough then shared a double bed with me. Our house had no air conditioning. It hadn’t been invented yet. During the hot summer months, somehow, we survived. We always slept with the windows open.  We could hear cars and trucks driving along highway 171 (MacArthur Drive) South of our house. I loved hearing the trains coming down the old Frisco railroad track just a few blocks west of our house. I especially enjoyed hearing the train whistle when they approached a road crossing. And by the way, these were Big Iron, coal burning steam engines. Each engineer had his own “signature” way of blowing that whistle powered by steam from the engine. Really exciting. Another thing we did during those hot summer nights, we would sit out in the side yard and talk, tell stories (Dad had some good ghost stories) and look up at the Stars and Moon on a clear night.  Parents had lawn chairs; we children laid on blankets on the ground.

Webb City is an old mining town. The town was literally surrounded by old, abandoned Lead and Zink mines North to Oronogo, and East to Carterville, and there were mines as far West as Pitcher, Oklahoma. There were some South of town but not that many. The town is named after John Webb who accidentally found deposits of Lead and Zink while plowing his field in the late 1800’s. He became one of the richest men in Missouri. At the peak of the mining boom the population of Webb City was over 20,000.

The population during my time was around 5000 to 8000. Most of the remains of the mines are gone now and a lot of the land has been reclaimed. But during my time the “Chat Piles “as we called them, were huge piles of rocks and gravel which were left behind after the Lead and Zink or “Jack” had been extracted. They were everywhere North and East of town. There were also open pits where the ore had been taken out.  The biggest one was in Oronogo North of town, which got its name form a letter written to the field manager of the mine from the home office, which read “ore or no go”. Oronogo Circle at one time was the largest open pit mine in the world. One quarter mile wide and half a mile long, and over 300 feet deep by the time all the ore was extracted.  From the water level down, it was 250 feet at the deepest point. The water was crystal clear and as blue as any tropical water in the world.  What a great swimming hole.  It’s listed in the Scuba Divers Bible as a great place to dive. People from all over the US and some from around the world to dive there. Other names of mines in the area are Daylight, Davey, Nevada, Yellow dog, Red Dog, Black Cat, and Center Creek and Sucker Flats. There were many others, too many to name.

Webb City was laid out as many mid-western towns are.  Main Streets North & South and Crossroads East & West.  With allies between and parallel to the N&S streets.  The dividing line for North and South was Daugherty St. and East and West was Main St. Our house was at 603 North Liberty St. Just two blocks from the end of liberty St. The house was originally a mule barn and livery stable way back in 1890. (See photo). At the end of Liberty Street there was about two acres of land and a barn where Goats were raised and there were also some pig pins on the edge of the lot right next to a little dry bed creek. A few yards further North stood a huge pile of gravel, this at the time was one of the largest Chat Piles in the area. Surrounded by an area of chats rocks and mine shafts and old mine pillars and pits of water all the way to Oronogo northwest, or Carterville going East. My friends and I spent countless hours roaming around and exploring just about every inch of the “chats”. The greatest playground a young boy could possibly ask for. From the top of the big chat at the end of Liberty Street we could see airplanes take off and land at the Joplin Airport…. What a view. We rode down the East side of the chat pile on our bikes and down the West side on an old car fender, what a ride. In the wintertime when we got a good snow this was a great place to go sledding.

One of our favorite summer activities was swimming. The hardest part was deciding where to go, we had a lot of choices. There was the city pool at Hatten Park, Center creek, about three miles North of town, Spring River about two miles North of Center Creek.  Oronogo Circle, Silver Deck, Malabo, Sucker Flats, Daylight Cave all North or east of town in the Chats. On special occasions we got to go to the pool near Grandmother’s house in Joplin at Leonard Park.  Shiffendecker pool in Joplin or Readings Mill South of Joplin or Silom Springs, to name a few.

Allies were quite an attraction for most kids (boys) in town.

When going to and from we would always take an alley rather than a street. Except at night, the streets were lit at night and allies were dark and could be very scary. During daylight hours though, they were more interesting than streets, more fun, and were also a source of income.  In those days, every house had a burn barrel and a container of some kind for their trash behind their house in the alley. It may sound kind of weird, but we would look to see what we could find in the trash.  The burn barrel was of no interest for obvious reason, but we never knew what we might find in people’s trash. An old radio, a broken toy, pop bottles, any kind of metal, a cigar box.  I think every boy in town had one or two cigar boxes to keep his stuff in. Old tools, a broken lamp, old shoes, belts, anything we might be able to sell or use. The alley next to our house between Liberty St and Webb St. ran from the chat pile North all the way up to Dougherty St. next to the Civic Theater where it ended.

The Railroad tracks between WC and Oronogo were a big attraction. We would use them as a shortcut to Oronogo Circle Mine. Along the way we would see who could walk on the rail longest before falling off. Sometimes we would lay a penny on the rail when a train was coming and watch it grow bigger and bigger as the train rolled by.  Some of the high points along the way, Creech’s Pond, the Telephone relay Building, Saddle Canyon, the trestle which crossed over a dry bed creek where we would stand under as a train rumbled over and feel the earth shake under our feet, great fun. And miles of chat piles and old mines along the way. 

## Our Neighborhood Store  

![May's Grocery Store](../../assets/images/my-story/mays-grocery.jpg)

May’s Grocery Store located at 504 N. Pennsylvania St. was our neighborhood store, a short walk from our home on N. Liberty St. The building is not standing today, it was razed sometime in the early 70’s. Mr. and Mrs. May lived next door to the store. A big white house on the conner of Penn and Wood St. The store was small but served the neighborhood well. The store was stocked with all the basic items. Bread, milk, eggs, flour, sugar, lunch meat, canned goods, etc.   I made many a trip to the store to fetch a loaf of bread, eggs, quart of milk, whatever Mom needed on short notice.

For the kids in the hood, the main points of interest were the coke machine, or the penny candy counter. Then there was the peanut machine and gumball machines hanging on the column next to the meat counter.  And oh, the pickle jar that sat on top of the meat counter containing huge dill pickles, 5 cents each. If we were lucky enough to scrape up 6 cents selling scrap iron at Earnie Burns scrap yard, or pop bottles for which we could get 2 cents each at the store.  We would spend it at May’s Store. On a hot summer day, we would get a coke for 5 cents and a hand full of peanuts for one cent and set out on the bench in front of the store a coke in one hand and peanuts in the other and watch the world go by. If we only had a penny to spend, we would try our luck with the gumball machine. There were many colored balls of gum in the glass dome and a few spotted balls were in there too. If you were lucky enough to get one, it would create a lot of excitement in the store. It was worth 5 cents in cash or merchandise which would immediately be spent at the penny candy counter. If not, well you still dad a ball of gum to chew on. Can you visualize two or three kids sitting on that bench on the front porch?
