# Chapter Four:  *Gentleman’s Agreement*

I have no idea how much time passed or the details of the outcome of the robbery attempt.   One thing for sure, the “Club” was demolished, the Cafe and Liquor store and surrounding property remained.

Because of the absence of the Club there was not enough income to support a partnership.  Dad later explained to me how a partnership was to end in the business world.  One partner goes to the other and offers a choice,” Buy or Sell”. This is Biblical. Of course, I did not know it at the time.  Many years later I read in Genesis 13: 1-11 where Abram asks Lot to choose which section of land he wanted, and Abram would take the other.  When Dad asked Eddie Buy or Sell.  Eddie Chose to buy, and that ended the partnership. Dad used some of the money to pay off the mortgage on our house. I can remember dad saying to me “the house is paid for now and no matter what happens we will always have a home.”
