# Chapter Six: *We did not move to Riverton, KN.*
One of the things that didn’t work out was a Gambling Casino planned in an old Mansion sitting on a hillside overlooking a lake at Riverton Kansas.  The plan was for us to live upstairs and the Game and restaurant downstairs.  The plan all hinged on my dad’s friend MR. Southland being elected Sheriff of the county where the Mansion was located.  This was the person who was the Sheriff of the county where Bagdad (Hell’s half acre) was located.  And he relocated to Riverton area later.  He had a son my age and one-time dad was visiting Mr. Southland and he took me along. The boy had a two-man sailboat which we had a good time with on the lake.  Mr. Southland was not elected so the plans to move to Riverton KN were scrapped.  Dad did hire Mr. Southland to do some work at our house in Webb City while he was “between Jobs”.  He completely renovated our upstairs bathroom adding a nice double sink and a shower tub.  At the time that was the only bathroom in the house.   Boy, that first shower really felt good.  None of us were used to such luxury.

Later Mr. Southland landed a position of Postmaster in the Riverton area which he kept until retirement many years later. He and Dad were exceptionally good friends, and we were all happy for him and his family.  I for one was very relieved that we did not move to Riverton, KN. I wanted to stay where we were, 603 North Liberty St. Webb City, MO. Oh yes later Dad hired a plumber to add a half bath with a shower downstairs.  He also updated the Kitchen with a double sink and a new Gas Range and Refrigerator. One more move that did not happen went like this. Out near the City Limits Southwest of town and near the Joplin airport, there was an old Mansion which was really run down and had not been lived in for years. For about a two-mile stretch along the road leading up to the house and on past the house for about half mile, there was a block rock fence. It must have been quite a place in its day.  Dad wanted to buy the property and build a new house using the blocks from the fence. Not a bad idea but it did not work out. Do not know why, but again I was happy that it did not. I lived there on North Liberty with my three Brothers and family for many happy years.
