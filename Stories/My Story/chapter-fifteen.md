# Chapter fifteen:  Dan and Vera Murphy Family

William Daniel Murphy and Vera Callie Marison were married June 1, 1934, in Neosho, Mo. Dan was born in Webb City, MO Dec. 30, 1912. Vera was born in Joplin, MO April 17, 1914.

They met at Lakeside Park where he ran a shooting gallery. Vera and her family visited Lakeside often for entertainment and recreation as many families in the area did in those days.

After they married, they lived the rest of their lives in Webb city except for a brief time in Arkansas City, KN.

They had four children, Melvin 1937, David 1940, James 1943 and Vern 1949. All were born in Webb City except James who was born in Arkansas City, KN.

In the early years of their marriage Dan worked for the Blake Movie theater where he played the organ and did sound effects for the silent movies. Much later he became somewhat of an entrepreneur, starting and operating several businesses in and around Webb City.

Vera was a busy mother raising four boys, a Homemaker and was active in the Parent Teachers Association (PTA) at Webster Elementary for 11 years. She also made sure her boys were in Church every Sunday at First Baptist Church where she taught Sunday school for years. I remember visiting Mom after she had moved to (the high rise) apartment to see how she was getting along. It was 1990 something. There was a nice plaque hanging on the wall that she had received from the church. It said, “In Recognition of 60 years teaching Sunday school.” I was standing there looking at it with a question mark on my face, when She said, “Yeah they got it wrong, it was only 50 years”. I had to laugh. Only 50 years Mom?

Dad died June 3, 1959, and Mom Nov. 27, 2002.

I guess I’m the last man standing. David died Dec. 23, 2006, Vern May 8, 2009, and Melvin died Aug. 15, 2012. Melvin and I were shocked when Vern died, especially Melvin who was oldest. Neither of us expected Vern to go before us.

I remember what I was doing the day Vern died, I worked all day at the Church. The classrooms in the basement had all been upgraded and I finished the painting in the 9 -12 grade classroom late that day.  When I got home the news was reporting a strong wind that came through the mid-west. I had planned to call Vern and ask about it, but it was so late after dinner that I put it off till the next day.  I never got a chance to call, early the next day Melvin called me and said that Vern was dead. Melvin was really upset.  He said that Vern was shot by accident very early that morning. I want to believe it was an accident, but it was reported as suicide. Vern’s wife, Shirley told me later that her brother said that the pistol in question, a 9MM, was known to have a hair trigger. I guess we’ll never know for sure. I only wish I had called him the night before.

Dad died from cirrhosis of the liver at St John Hospital in Joplin after a long illness. Mom had asked me to drive her over to visit him. He had died just before we got to the hospital. The doctors and nurses were trying to revive him but could not.

David, Vern and I were still living at home at the time. David was working at John Hutchins Auto parts store; I was working washing dishes at Leo’s Green Lantern restaurant and Melvin was working in Louisiana and came home. It was summertime and I was in-between my JR and Sr year in HS. Vern was only ten years old.

Mom was a stay-at-home Mother, as most mothers were in those days. She was a great cook and would get lots of good stuff to eat from Grandmother Marison’s Garden.

The following summer we had a family reunion on Table Rock Lake

Mom said a man and his wife came through town pulling a little camper and horse trailer. They were coming up Liberty St. and parked in front of our house and ask Mom if she would like to have a photo of her children and explained the setting. Mom went for it and I’m glad she did. I was 3 years old at the time, Dave was 6, and Melvin 9. Note that this was a black and white photo which was “Colorized” with some kind of paint. A real art form of the day. All films at that time were B&W.

Thanks to one of my mother’s cousins, Lee Sommerville, daughter of Lillian, I have more information and photos from her side. 
Great Grandmother Murphy and Grandmother Marison were both delighted when Mom married a Murphy.

I have no information on Grandfather Marison’s parents, I do have a photo of them. I think they were from Sweden. Grandmother Marison had a recipe for “Swedish” pancakes which was passed on to her from her mother-in-law. She passed it on to mom. This was one of our favorite breakfast treats, they were known as “Thin pancakes” around our house. The pancakes were a special treat, we all loved them. My brother Melvin had a copy of the original recipe. He fixed some for Kathy and me during one of our visits. He even had some of Mom’s cooking tools and a jar of KYRO Syrup, the same brand that mom used years ago. He was a real stickler for details. Those pancakes brought back a lot of memories. Grandfather Marison died 1944 so I never knew him. I do know that he was one of the first Ministers at Forest Park Baptist Church in Joplin and worked at the Joplin Foundry. He also had a machine shop behind their house on 6th street in Joplin. Grandmother said he would bring home parts from the foundry and turn them down on a lathe. It must have been a big lathe because he was working on wheels for freight trains. I have a faint memory of being in the shop and someone with a big smile, picking me up and saying, “hey young man, what are you doing in here?” Was that my grandfather? I have such a faint memory of that incident; it could have been my Uncle Mars if the timeframe was 1945 since he would have been home from World War two by then.

Grandmother Marison was a great lady. The 5th of 10 children. She was raised in an Irish family at a time when it was common for girls to go only to the third grade in school.  Because it was believed that by that time, they would be able to read, write, and know arithmetic, and would be more useful at home than in school. Nowadays, parents would rather have them in school rather than home. But that’s the way it was so she and her 5 sisters only went to the third grade.

Grandmother was a Bible scholar, she knew the bible inside and out, cover to cover.  She had a great sense of humor and loved to kid around. Always invited to our house for Thanksgiving dinner. And always invited all her children and their children over to her house Christmas Eve. She would make popcorn balls for the kids, 10 of us, and cake for the grownups. Punch for the kids and tea or coffee for the aunts and Uncles. Dad never came, I think he would go to Christmas Mass at the Catholic church in Webb City that evening. Grandmother gave a small gift to each of us kids. Our parents knew she couldn’t afford it, but she insisted.

Each summer we would go for a picnic on Shoal creek near Reding’s Mill. The park had lots of things for us kids, Swings, Slides, teeter totters and a merry go round powered by one of us boys. The main attraction was the swimming pool, It was gigantic, 175feet wide and 250 feet long. Had three big slides, high and low diving boards, and a contraception in the middle of the pool which was impossible to stay on if you were able to get on it because it was rocking and rolling and would tip you right off again.

Grandmother and Mom would bring lots of pop to drink and a huge watermelon. They would cook hamburgers and hot dogs on a big iron cooker next to each picnic table which were scattered all over the park. Grandmother would aways tell us “Those grates were made by your grandfather at the foundry.” Mom would say “that’s right”.
Shoal Creek was always fun also. I don’t remember swimming there, but we always would go down and wade and get some mud between our toes and throw some rocks in.  We would see who could skip a flat rock across the water and then argue who’s went the farthest or skipped the most.

Below is a photo taken in 1978. Our son Sean in the foreground, and Becky, LeeAnn and Pam in Shoal Creek. After Grandmother died, Mom carried on the tradition when we were all grown with our own kids. Any time we were home for a visit we would spend a day at the park.

Grandmother could not pronounce her A’s. She would introduce herself as Mrs. Morrison.  It was not until I read my uncle’s obituary in the Joplin Globe years later, that I realized his name was Mars, not Morse.  Everyone in the family called him Morse. He must have had a good sense of humor, he never corrected anyone.  I sent birthday cards to a Mrs. Morrison who lived on sixth street in Joplin for years. I had been to Grandmothers house many times as a child. I knew it was on sixth street but did not know the house number. After I moved to Tulsa, I looked in the Joplin phone book for a Mrs. Morrison on sixth Street and sent cards. The lady probably thought “who is this, Guy sending me cards?

A description of Grandmother Marison’s house. Small but very inviting, big enough for a family of five, all three children were born in that house. Two-bedroom one bath, kitchen large living room, enclosed back porch, front porch with swing. On a large lot with a huge garden directly behind the house and Granddad’s workshop on the NW corner.  A chicken coop and outbuilding or shed west of the workshop. A fishpond at the NE corner of the house in view from the kitchen window, full of very large goldfish. There was always a jar of oatmeal next to the pond. We boys would race to see who would be the first to feed the fish upon arrival to Grandmother’s house for a visit. Usually Sunday dinner. About one Sunday a month each for our family, Aunt Retha’s family and Uncle Mar’s family. One Sunday we would rotate to have Grandmother to our house for Sunday dinner. Dinners were a real treat. Usually, fried chicken green beans and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Sometimes corn, and fresh vegies from the garden. Homemade yeast rolls fresh from the oven. I especially liked when we had green beans with new potatoes. And of course, dessert. Homemade pies, cake, jello, and in the summer, homemade ice-cream. Grandmother always had a very large garden which had a Vineyard along one side the length of the garden with green and purple grapes. She and Mom spent a lot of time in our basement canning all the produce on an old gas range in our basement. They could stay a little cooler down there while canning everything which was very hot work. There used to be a photo viewer and a lot of photos which would give a three-dimensional effect out in the cupboard on the back porch. We kids would spend some time out there while the parents talked. Grandmother had a radio, no one had a TV in those days. She would always be found reading her Bible sitting in her rocking chair. Much later she did have a TV and spent a lot of time watching BILLY Graham revivals.  She loved Billy and even went to Oklahoma City to see him with some of her friends from Church. Grandmother would always come to our house for Thanksgiving dinner. She would always bring a dish and desert which we boys really enjoyed.

Christmas Eve was always spent at Grandmother’s house. Mom and us boys, Uncle Mar’s and Aunt (LOOK Up) and their kids Sharon and Sammy. Aunt Retha and Uncle John and their kids Tom, Kenneth and his twin sister Margaret.

We had popcorn balls, Drinks, and a gift for everyone. It wasn’t much because she was on a very limited income.  I don’t know how she could afford even a small gift for everyone. She always had a Christmas tree and decorations next to her front window. We really enjoyed the popcorn balls, kind of sticky but we didn’t mind.
