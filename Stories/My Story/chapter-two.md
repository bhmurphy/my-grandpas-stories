# Chapter Two:   *Bagdad*

Later Dad and Eddie became partners and opened a business consisting of a liquor store, restaurant, and Gambling Hall they named Bagdad, often referred to as the “Club”. This mini conglomerate was on the Kansas Missouri state line West of Joplin. The Liquor store was on the Missouri side, and the restaurant and “Club” were on the Kansas side. I have many good memories of this layout. The buildings were next to a highway, across the highway to the South was a steep mountain side and wooded area. One of the workers for Dad and Eddie named Rochester who told us kids that it was the Big Rock Candy Mountain.  Melvin and David may have known about the song with that title, but I did not have a clue. I thought there really was hard rock candy and a lemonade stream up there. A creek ran down the mountain side under a bridge and down the hill behind the Restaurant and Club to Shoal Creek in the valley.  We would lay a tin can on its side in that clear cold water and catch crawfish to use for fish bait. This was a great place for us kids to run and play, fish and explore. There were plenty of fish to catch in Shoal creek. I do not remember ever swimming in shoal creek, I might not have been old enough, but I bet Dave and Melvin did.

Every year Eddie and Dad would have a big BBQ picnic and party for all their friends and customers. That was a big deal, lots of people came out. The restaurant and liquor store did good business, but the main source of income was the club. One of Dad’s favorite customers was Wilde Red Berry, a professional wrestler from Kansas. He used to stop by the store often.  One night Dad took us boys over to the Memorial Hall in Joplin to watch Wilde Red Berry and Gorgeous George wrestling. Man did they put on a show. I Think I had more fun watching the fans than I did watching the match.

Every time Red Berry got the advantage on Gorgeous George his manager would jump in the ring and clobber Red Berry with a folding chair. Of course, the Referee wouldn’t see this, and the crowd would go wild, screaming and yelling at the Referee. Wow what a fun night.

One Saturday night it was business as usual at the club. Lots of people at the Crap Table, Slot Machines and Blackjack and Poker tables. It was customary to provide free food and drinks for the customers so there was a bar and lounge area for that purpose.

Things were rolling along nicely when three young men came in and one pulled a gun and announced, “Everyone! Hands up and line up facing the wall”. Dad who was dealing Craps at the time closed the cash box (the Bank) and slid it down his leg to the floor under the table. Dad said later that these guys were real amateurs.  They had no clue about the “Bank” which contained several thousand dollars in cash.   Dad was a very flashy dresser and had a big diamond ring on his right hand which he turned around to look like a simple gold band as he stood hands up on the wall. By this time, the young man with a gun went to the bar and helped himself to a half pint bottle of whiskey. Meantime the other two were going down the line collecting loot.  They had not been at it for long when the one with the gun pointing at the line of folks at the wall took a big drink of whiskey and (he said later) his “gun went off” and shot one of the gamblers in the back of his head, killing him.  The three would be robbers panicked and ran out.  This situation was bad enough but to make matters worse the young man who was killed was a Kansas State Representatives son.  The story hit all news outlets and later the “Crime Detectives Magazine” did a feature front page article about the incident titled “Hells Half Acre”.  I wish I had a copy of the magazine. It pictured the “Casino” with elaborate furnishings, chandeliers and everyone in formal dress and Tuxes.  Which was far from the truth, I am sure there were well dressed people there but there were also some in blue jeans, boots and cowboy hats, just everyday people.

The three young men did not get far, they were arrested and spent a great deal of time in prison.
