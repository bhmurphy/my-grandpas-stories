# Chapter Nine *We Had to leave the country, for a while.*
Dad came home one afternoon in 1956 and announced we were going on vacation, possibly for a Month.  At this point in time my oldest brother Melvin had been working in Louisiana for about a year.  Dads’ cousin Cecil Byler who worked for Superior oil company got him a job there. My brother David was 15 or 16, I was 12 or 13 and Vern 6 or 7years old.  
Dad had a friend who owned a resort on a lake in Minnesota near Winnomygosh.  We would be leaving right away. Mom packed our bags, and we jumped in the 55 Buick and headed North the next day.
Dad and David did all the driving.  Mom, Vern and I just set back and watched the world go by in air-conditioned comfort, the Buick was our first car with air conditioning.    I remember watching the Jack Rabbits bounding in and out of the tall grass as we passed through the Dakota Prairie lands. We also saw the huge statues of Paul Bunion & Babe the Blue Ox as we passed through Bemidji, Minn.

Near the Lodge on Lake Bemidji where we would be staying.

When we arrived at the Lodge we were amazed at the size of the Lake.  You could not see from one side to the other. The owner of the Lodge said it was 32 miles across. He also said that it was the headwaters for the Mississippi River.  The water was crystal clear David, and I were excited about going swimming until we noticed the huge leaches in the water. We decided to fish and explore instead.

The Cabins were nice and had all the dishes, pots, pans and utensils Mom would need to cook.  The beds were comfortable and warm, it got cold at night.  The Lodge was big and had everything one might need to hunt or fish. Dad bought us kids a nice Fish Knife with imitation Bone handle and a cutting blade plus a combination fish scaler and fishhook remover blade. I still have mine.  The lodge had a log cabin rustic exterior and nice restaurant and dining room, plus, a game room with pool tables and pinball machines. There were slot machines in another room, but we were not allowed in there. Minnesota is called the land of ten thousand lakes. At least, and maybe more.

Dad joked that this was the same lodge where John Dillinger and his gang had a shootout with FBI agents. A Joke? Maybe it was true. We had a blast fishing, exploring and just riding around in the boat. Dave caught the biggest fish.  A nice Rock Bass. We spent two weeks at the lodge, then went on to Winnipeg Manitoba Province, Canada.

I don’t remember very much about Canada. We stayed at a hotel in downtown Winnipeg. We found out the next morning that they had some quite different hours concerning breakfast. By the time we all got up and dressed for the day it was about 9:30 AM.   Not bad for Mom Dad and three boys. When we went down to the dining room for breakfast, the waiter informed us that we were too late for breakfast. Mother asked him what the hours were, and he said 5AM to 9AM. Wow that is early. Mom called room service from then on.  She said there is no way I can get everyone down there before 9AM. The exchange rate for money was $1.25 US for $1.00 Canadian at that time.  Today it is $1.30 Canadian for $1.00 US.

There was a pool hall next door to the hotel.  Dave and I went in to check it out.  Everything was about the same as back home except the Snooker tables were larger than the ones back home. Probably 1/3 or more larger than ours.

Down the street from the pool hall there was a shooting gallery. The kind you see at carnivals with 22 rifles and all kinds of targets. Dad bet the two guys running the gallery that he could split a playing card place on its edge, in half with one shot. The owner took him up on it. They placed an Ace of Spades poker card on its edge in a crack between two boards next to a target. Dad took a couple of shots with the rifle at a target to get his windage down, then fired one shot dead center through the big Spade in the center of the card. The two guys were impressed to say the least.  So was Dave and me. They paid the bet but were not to upset because Dad had drawn quite a crowd with his trick shot and several people wanted to do some shooting also. Just for a cupid doll though. Dad told Dave and I later that he used to run a shooting gallery at Lakeside Park back home. And would make some extra money that way. I saw Dad do the same thing out behind his liquor store at Dunewig with a 30-30 lever action rifle.  The card was stuck edgewise in the fork in a tree and split right down the middle.

We went to a movie one night and to the Dog races the next night.  The race tracks the betting, and all were just like a horse race. That was probably the first time I had ever seen a greyhound Dog.  Man could they run. We were surprised that it did not get dark till after 10pm.  The locals said it was because we were far North.

After we had been in Canada for a little over a week, Dad made a long-distance call to someone back home.  When he hung up, he said to Mom, “we can go home now”.  Years later Mom told us the reason we left the country. A Grand Jury was to convene, and Dad did not want to testify so we left before he could be served. A Month or so earlier Dad and his partner Les had gotten word that the “Game” would be raided, and they needed to close quick.  They were able to get everyone out and Dad, Ollie, Art, Lester and Clarence, one of Lester’s employees in the pool hall managed to get all the evidence of a gambling hall out of the room before the raid. Mom told us that there were three slot machines, one silver dollar, one half dollar, and one quarter dollar that were taken out and thrown down a mine shaft not far away between Webb city and Carterville.  The thing is, they didn’t have time to empty the machines before they dumped them.  Remember at that point in time all coins, except a penny of course, were silver. The amount of money was probably in the hundreds of dollars or possibly thousands of dollars.  So, in today’s market it would be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of coins.  There were two mine shafts that were close to town between Webb and Carterville. The first was(name?)  only a few blocks east of Main Street right behind the old Streetcar line to Lakeside and the second would be Daylight Cave a little North near the city dumps. Daylight cave was the most likely location. It was a little more remote and further from town but easy access to the shaft.  Word must have gotten around about the incident and some years later one of the local young men from Webb City who was a scuba diver dove down there looking for the slot machines and never came up. He may have gotten lost in one of the horizontal caves or entangled somehow.  Several other divers spent hours looking but finally gave up for fear that they too could meet the same fate. Today those slot machines are buried under tons of dirt and rock. All the old mines in the area were filled in by the Federal Government EPA program. Except Oronogo Circle.  It was too big, and they gave up.  All they managed to do was ruin the local water wells and tear up the roads in town with the heavy trucks that were used to haul the fill dirt and rocks.  The contractor hired by Uncle Sam, left town and filed bankruptcy, leaving the town to clean up the mess and repair the roads.
