# Chapter Ten *the Game is Robbed, almost.*
The game was upstairs over the pool hall. The pool hall would always close at 9pm, but he Games upstairs would continue well past 9pm and people could come and go through the back door facing the alley behind the building. This door was always locked. Weekends were usually the busiest, mid-week was steady but not too busy. On weekends the game would not close until after midnight or early morning. When they did close for the night Dad would bring the Bankroll home in a brown paper bag, usually several thousand dollars in cash.

There was a parking lot behind the pool hall just across the alley and behind the Sinclair Gas Station at the conner of Webb and Broadway streets. Dad, the Dealers and most of the customers would park there. The parking lot was not lighted. There was a light over the back door of the pool hall. When they closed for the night, Dad would exit the back door along with two of the dealers, Art W. and Oley E. Oley would come out first, then Dad, then Art behind Dad. All three would scan the area and the parking lot. Then Oley would cross over the alley to Dad’s car and open the driver’s side door, look inside and motion for Dad to come over. Art would stay behind and keep watch until Dad got into the car. Oley would drive his car out first, followed by Dad, then Art. Then they would proceed to our house, a short drive to North Liberty St. from the pool hall. There were three routes they could take, Via Webb, Main or Liberty streets. They never took the same route twice in a row, always changing one way or another. When they arrived at our house, Dad would park in the driveway next to the house, walk to the side door and enter. Art and Oley watching until he made it into the house and then go on their way.

This was an exceptionally good plan that never altered. It proved how good one Saturday night when Oley opened Dad’s car door and there was a guy crouched behind the driver’s seat of Dad’s car, with a 45-automatic pistol. Oley stepped back and yelled “DAN!” The would-be robber jumped out of the car (4 door) and ran away.  Good thing too. Dad Art and Oley were all armed.  The guy wore a mask and it all happened so fast that no one could identify him. No shots were fired, and the police were not informed of this incident. No need for this to hit the local news.
