# Chapter Twelve *The Coupe*

Sometime later David got a job at John Hutchinson’s Auto Parts store downtown after school. He saved up enough money to buy our Uncle Herbert Byler’s old Model A Ford. A 1930 five window coupe which was out in the barn on his farm gathering dust for years. The idea was to make it a Hot Rod or Street Rod which was the rage in those days. This turned out to be a major project, but we had a lot of help form our cousin, Kenneth McMullen our Mother’s Sisters boy who had restored a model T and a Model A that looked like they had just rolled out of the Factory. He said he would help us, and he did. I’m sure we would not have been able to do it without his help. Kenneth knew so many people in the area that he had met when he was restoring his old cars who could do things for us. Kenny recommended that we install a v8 engine and change the running gear for hydraulic brakes.  We did that by buying an old 1939 ford and removing the body and putting the model A body on that frame after we had shortened it about 18 inches.  David found a ford Flathead v8 I believe it was a 1948 AB.  The cylinders were bored out 60 degrees and Dome pistons installed. We found Edelbrock aluminum finned heads and added chrome nut covers. The cam was ground by Otis Cline who was a master machinist in the US Navy retired. The original fire wall was replaced with stainless steel. We had a chrome generator and chrome wire looms. A dual two-barrel intake manifold with Stromberg 97 carburetors. A three-speed floor shift synchro mesh transmission and a 411-rear end. Kenny found an 1950 Mercury padded dashboard cut down to replace the model A dashboard with all the gauges. And when had Naugahyde red and black rolled and pleated, upholstery. We had whitewall tires 800’s on the rear, with spinner hubcaps. Painted with dark grey primer. We never seem to raise enough money for a paint job. Bodywork was done by Delmer Moore at the Empire Garage on Liberty St. We had the cloth and wooden ribs in the top of the cab replaced with 1/8-inch sheet metal. Delmer said he used 20 lbs. of lead to fill in the gaps.  There was no bondo in those days.  The bucket seats were from an old Crossley that Kenny found somewhere. The old cowl gas tank which leaked was replaced with a 20-gallon tank placed in the trunk area with an electric fuel pump.  The 12-volt battery was also located in that area, with no room for luggage.  Because of the 411 rear end top speed was around 105 miles an hour so we didn’t win many ¼ mile races. In town though, from streetlight to streetlight we could beat anyone, corvettes included. The “Coupe” as we called it would come off the line like it was shot out of a cannon. We had a great time with that old Model A. Thanks to David who provided the money, Kenneth, who provided the brains, and yours truly who provided the busted knuckles.

The finished project. With new Intake manifold, Chrome Generator and Oil Filter Canaster.

Dave drove it to work and later to College in Pittsburg KN until Dad died June 1959 and he had to drop out. Later Dave went out to California with Charlie and Bob Merrett to make their fortune. The fortune was mine though because I got to drive the Coupe to school and to work after school during my Sr. Year.
