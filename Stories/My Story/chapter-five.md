# Chapter five:  *Dan Murphy Entrepreneur*

Dad was an entrepreneur before entrepreneurs were cool.

So, Dad and Eddie parted company and Dad started planning what to do with the proceeds for his half of Baghdad. His next venture. He did use some of the money to pay off the mortgage on our house.  Eddie stayed on at Baghdad for a time and years later helped develop property around the “New” Table Rock Lake, near Branson, MO in the Ozark mountains. The lake was formed when the White River was Damned for a hydro power plant which produced electricity for the area.

## A list of Dan Murphy’s ventures (after Baghdad):  Over a period of approximately 15 years.

* A liquor store on 7th street just outside Dunewig, MO East of Joplin (Dan’s Package Store)
* There may have been a Gas Station in Dunewig, I am not sure about that.
* A Restaurant on Range Line in Joplin South of the Elms Motel and North of 7th street. Dan’s Diner.
* A 10-acre farm North of Alba, MO
* A 100-acre farm North of Webb City near center creek.
* Dan’s Little Mexico at West 7th St. and Shiffendecker Road, Joplin, MO.
* Bait and Tackle shop on Range line Webb City MO across from WC Drive-in Where Wendy’s now stands.
* Game over Pool Hall, Webb city downtown Daugherty St.
* Confidential Loan company, South Webb St. Webb city

There may have been more, that I do not know about.   And there were some that were planned but didn’t work out, exactly.
