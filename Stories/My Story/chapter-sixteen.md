# Chapter Sixteen: Movies, Drive Ins, Restaurants.

![Civic Theater](../../assets/images/funny-stories/theater.jpg)

The Blake theater before it burned and was moved to new location on Daugherty St. and named The Civic Theater. Two more to come later, the Larson on Main St. and the Junior right across the street. Only one remains in Webb City, the old Larsen renamed the 66 Theater on Main Street.  Joplin had three movie theaters on Main Street. The Fox Theater was the most popular and largest. It was a grand place and very ornate, a beautiful place.  We had one drive in the theater in Webb City, located where Murphy Oil and Walmart are now on Madison Ave.  Joplin had one way out on South Madison. And Carthage had one, the Rt. 66 Drive, located on old Rt. 66 SW of town. It was Mom and Dad’s favorite, and we spent many Friday nights out there in the Summer. What I remember is that I was always the one who had to go up to the concession stand and get everybody’s popcorn and drinks. Vern was too young, and Melvin and David were too old. Somehow, I was always able to remember everyone’s order and make my way back to the car without getting lost most of the time. It was always a treat, and we all enjoyed the movies and a special night out. They used to charge admission for each person in the car for a long time.  Later though they just charged for the carload. When we were teens, we would pool our money and spend more time talking and cutting up than watching the movie. The Civic, Larson and Junior were all owned by one family. And if it was your birthday you got in free.  We all thought that was great until we reached age 13 and had to pay the adult admission price. Yes, according to the Larsons we were adults at 13 years old. Of course, we still got in free that day but had to pay from then on.  The Civic was the best of all, they always had the most recent first run movies. The largest and best seats, a grand entry way and a cry room for parents with children. The Civic had the best concession stand too. I remember Judy Meslin worked there on Saturdays and she lived one block South of us on Liberty Street. I think she was David’s age. She would always give me a big smile and ask “are you sure that’s all you want? We have a special on Hershey bars today.” I would blush and say, “no thanks” and hurry away. Really if I had the money, I would have bought anything from her.

The Larson and Junior theaters catered to the kids more than the adults. The Junior had all “B” movies and was the cheapest to get in, ten cents. The seats were wooden and not very comfortable. The Larson was next and the Civic was the best of the three theaters.  lots of Western movies. Roy Rogers (my favorite), Gene Autry (Dicks Favorite), Hop along Cassidy were regulars. And once a Month on a Saturday they would light up the stage between movies had have a drawing. The manager would come out on stage and call out ticket numbers. If he called the number on your ticket, you would win a prize. A free drink or candy or some other small gift. He would call out three or four of those and then say, “and now for the grand prize.” Which would be something special. I won the grand prize one Month. A set of western style Saddle Bags! Black with silver buckles and trim. They looked great on my bike. I’ll never forget that day. I also remember when Smiley Burnette, Gene Autry’s side kick was there at the Larson for a day. He had a little trailer parked in front of the Larson and kids could have their picture taken with him. I don’t remember how much it cost but I had my picture taken along with many more boys and girls that day.  It’s not every day you can have your photo taken with a movie star. I wish I still had the photo. PS, he didn’t have his dog with him that day.

There were several Drive-in theaters in the area. Joplin had two out on Range Line. North of town. Carthage had The Route 66 drive in just outside of town between Cartage and Carterville on old Rt. 66. Webb City Was late getting one. It was also on Range Line, across from Montie’s kreamy Kup drive in restaurant and Ray Holland’s Service Station. (Find pics) Once built and in service it was the Friday or Saturday night date choice for most Webb City kids.
