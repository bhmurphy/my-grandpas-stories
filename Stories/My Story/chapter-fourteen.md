# Chapter Fourteen *Grandparents, Great Grandparents, (Aunts and Uncles))*

## Dad’s side of the family:

My Grandfather came over to US from Ireland at age 15.  Melvin found a copy of his Naturalization Form on Ancestry.com. It is rather brief, all it said was that date of entry and the country of origin, Ireland. Dad’s Mother was a Byler and was the daughter of Elmer and Emma Byler who owned a 100-acre farm North of Webb City.  She married an Indian named Bitner, and they had two children, Roberta and Claud, who was the oldest. Later her husband died, and she remarried my grandfather Murphy July 21, 1911, in Carthage MO. They had one child Dan Murphy born Dec. 30, 1912. They were residing at 311 S. Main St. Webb City, MO at the time the photo was taken. Grandfathers’ occupation was listed on their marriage certificate as “Pool Hall Proprietor”. He died Nov. 11, 1925. David said he died in a shootout in Claremore, Ok. He was buried at Webb City cemetery South of town. He had invested in several oil leases in OK.  The oil boom was taking off at that time. Dad’s mother, Lola died sometime later and was buried beside her first husband. Dad inherited $25,000 when she died. The story as mom told it, she sent dad down to the grocery store for a dozen eggs, a pound of bacon and a quart of milk. Dad stopped by the Owl Bar on the way, and two weeks later he returned with a dozen eggs a pound of bacon and a quart of milk.

Our Grandfather and Grandmother, Aunt and Uncle and Dad in stroller, 3 Months old. Lola Florence Byler’s first husband was a Cherokee Indian, and they had two children, Claude & Roberta Bitner. When Mr. Bitner died, she married W.D. Murphy and they had one child, W.D. JR. The house where they were standing is located at 311 South Main St. Webb City, MO I have a recent photo of it somewhere.

The photo below was taken when Claude and his Wife Thelma were visiting. Aunt Roberta in center. That is a brand new 1952 Buick in the background. Uncle Claude and Aunt Thelma used to come up from Galveston Texas to see us often. We kids loved it when they visited. Claude always had lots of good stories to tell about growing up in Webb City, and Aunt Thelma was a great cook. They had two boys, Claude JR and Dan Murphy Bitner.

## Mom’s side of the family

Myrtle Lena Murphy, my grandmother, was born 17 March 1886 in Elm Springs, MO. She loved to tell the story about her mother and father, my Great Grandparents, arriving in Missouri from the Chicago area in a covered wagon pulled by a team of Mules. And how her father, after their first house in Elm Springs burnt down, traded the Mules for a house in Galena, KN which had been torn down. Galena was Just a few miles East of the Joplin, MO. The spot where he had acquired a lot at 712 Moffett Ave. Grandmother said that her father and brother (Pat) took a buckboard and hauled all the materials they needed for the building of their home. The X must have been the girl’s bedroom. There is another photo of the entire family out in front of this house. We were there to celebrate Great Grandmother’s 93rd birthday. (I’m looking for it) I remember it well; Gr. Grandmother had taken a fall and had a black eye.  Everyone was kidding her about getting it while playing baseball with the kids. The other thing I remember about that day. Dad had to get a push to get the car started when we were ready to leave the party because I had run the battery down listening to the radio in the car.

Grandmother had 4 sisters. Two other sisters, Olive died Nov. 1883 10 Months old, and Ethel Died 1898, living only one month.

Lillian married Earl Ferguson. Estella married John Lake and they moved to Kansas City. Of course, Myrtle married Oscar Marison, our grandfather. Bessie married a full blood Cherokee Indian Samuel B. Stokes. Katie never married, she moved to Carl Junction but went to Frisco Church in Webb City.  She faithfully sent each of us kids a nice birthday card every year up to the day she died. We used to joke about it later in life because they didn’t fit with our age. She was a sweet lady and always included a handwritten note. I still have the last card she sent to me in 1973. She said that she prayed that someday I would know Jesus Christ. Thank you, Aunt Katie, I did, we will meet again some day.

You may be thinking, two Murphy families? Yes, my father’s family were out of Hopkinsville, Ky and were Catholic.  I do not know when Grandfather Murphy moved to Webb City. I do know that he moved from Kentucky after his parents died around the time the Lead and Zink mining boom was taking place in and around Webb City.

One summer we vacationed in KY in the area around Wickliffe, KY near Mounds city where the Mound city National city Cemetery is located. Dad wanted to see if there were any long-lost relatives still there. Dad was driving the big black 1948 Buick which would make me around 5 years old, Melvin 11 and David 8, Vern wasn’t born yet. We crossed the Mississippi river on HY 60 where the Ohio and miss join. The bridge was long and narrow, one lane each way and 60 or 70 feet above the river. I looked out the window down to the river as we crossed and freaked out. I was scared to death. I closed my eyes and didn’t open them until we were across the bridge, which seemed to take forever.

Dad rented a nice cabin on a camp near the West Fork Mayfield River near Wickliffe. Dad, Melvin and David tried their best but couldn’t catch a fish. Dad saw two little barefoot boys fishing in some rocks in the river. He called them over and told them he would give them 5$ if they would catch some fish for or dinner. It wasn’t long before the boys caught a nice mess of trout. When Dad asks them what they used for bait, they said “Crickets”. The boys were delighted with their 5$ and we had a great dinner of fried fish prepared by mom.

The other thing that I remember about that trip is the Indian burial ground that we visited. I can’t describe it in words. I’m inserting a photo from a postcard Dad bought at the museum.

I don’t think Dad had much luck finding any Murphy relatives in the area. Unfortunately, we do not know much because Dad didn’t talk much about his childhood. When we returned home from the vacation, after crossing that bridge again, we realized the house was not locked. It really didn’t matter though, nothing was missing. Back then things were different. Nowadays we have the doors locked even when we are in the house.
