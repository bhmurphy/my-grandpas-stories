# Chapter One:  *We did not move to Las Vegas.*

We need to go back in time to around 1941. My Father, Dan Murphy and Mother, Vera and my two brothers, Melvin and David are living in Arkansas City, Kansas.

My Dad is working dealing Craps for two brothers, Bill, and Walt Deere. The “Club” as the establishment was known, was located across the road from the Strother Army Airfield, South of Winfield and North of Arkansas City. There were many military men and women there, in search of entertainment. Melvin told me that we lived in a farmhouse next to the Club.

They had been in business for several years before I was born in Arkansas City February 1943. By this time things were coming to an end. Possibly they had worn out their welcome or maybe they had all made so much money that they decided it was time to move on. And of course, the Second World War was still going strong. Bill and Walt put their money together and bought a gambling casino in Las Vegas named “The Thunderbird”, Bill and Walt wanted Dad to go partners with them, but he declined. He was a Webb City boy and that is where we were going. Years later Melvin told me about the time he visited Bill Deer at his Casino “The Mirage” in Las Vegas. Melvin was on leave from the Marine Base nearby and stopped by to see him one evening. Bill told Melvin that he and Walt were disappointed that Dad decided not to go with them to Vegas. Bill said, “Your Dad wanted to be a Big Fish in a small town, not a Small Fish in a big town.” I was six months old when we moved to our new home at 603 North Liberty St. Webb City MO.  View from Arch St.

Soon after we moved to Webb City, Dad opened a liquor store near Stones Corner on North Main St. in Joplin. That is where he met Eddie Daniels, a local Real-Estate developer who lived on a farm just across the highway from Joplin Airport. Dad was shot one night during a robbery at the Liquor Store. He was not seriously hurt but was laid up for a while. I do not know if the robber was ever caught. I am told that Melvin and David charged their school mates from Webster Elementary 5 cents each to view Dad’s bloody shirt. I must have been two or three years old at this time, I have no memory of the incident. This was one of the many stories that took place and were passed on to me later.
