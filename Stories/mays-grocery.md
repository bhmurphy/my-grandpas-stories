# May’s Neighborhood Grocery Store in the 40’s and 50’s

Mr. and Mrs. May’s store was located at 504 N Pennsylvania street.  A short walk from our house on N Liberty St. The building is not standing today.  It was razed sometime in the late 70’ or early 80’s.

The store was small but served our neighborhood well. It was stocked with all the basic items you would expect in a small neighborhood store. I made several trips over to the store to fetch a loaf of bread, eggs, milk, whatever Mom needed.

But for the kids in the hood the main interest was the penny candy counter, the coke machine, Peanut machine, and Gumball machine.  Oh yes, and the pickle jar that set on top of the meat counter containing huge dill pickles, 5 cents each.  Mr. May had the patience of job; he would quietly fish out just the pickle we wanted even if it was in the bottom of the jar.  Or stand behind the penny candy counter waiting for us to make up our mind which piece of candy to select.  The choices were endless. A Tootsie roll one cent, a Jaw Breaker one cent, Malt Balls 5 in a package two cents, a small Hershey Bar two cents, a small Babe Ruth Bar two cents.  My favorite was the Peanut butter Log one cent. choices, choices.

If we were lucky enough to scrape up 6 cents selling pop bottles (2 cents each) or some scrap metal at Ernie Burns scrap yard; 20 cents a pound for lead, one cent a pound for pig iron.  More about that later.  We would go to May’s especially on a hot summer day, get an ice-cold coke five cents, and a handful of peanuts from the peanut machine for one cent, set on the bench in front of the store a coke in one hand and peanuts in the other and watch the world go by.  Life was good.

Now if we only had one penny, we would usually gamble it at the gumball machine.  Yes gamble, there were a few “spotted” gum balls in the machine.  If you were lucky enough to get one you could cash it in for five cents in merchandise.  If not, well you still had a ball of gum. There was always a great deal of celebration and excitement when a spotted ball was found. Mr. May would hoop and holler and run back to the Candy counter ready to dish out 5 cents worth of candy.

Mr. and Mrs. May were genuinely nice people and obviously loved kids. Mrs. May would always be behind the counter and would check you out at the cash register.  Mr. May maned the candy counter and the meat counter.  If you needed say a half pound of bologna or cheese or something, he would swing into action slice it, weigh it, and wrap it up in short order.

Mr. and Mrs. May lived in the big white house next to the store at the NW corner of Pennsylvania and Wood Street.
