# Three Webster Boys

Three Webster Elementary boys, Vern, Kenny and Royal on a summer stroll down the railroad tracks between Webb City and Oronogo.  Probably on their way to Oronogo Circle mine for a cool swim.  Royal had brought along his trusty Red Rider BB gun.

As they walked along, they occasionally stopped to shoot a tin can or whatever.  When they came to the Railroad Trestle over a dry creek bed near Creech’s farm (by the way it was a lot of fun to stand under the trestle as a train passed overhead and feel the earth shake under your feet),  they spotted a 12-gauge shotgun shell lying beside the tracks. This was a live, never fired shotgun shell.

The boys thought it would a great idea, at the time anyway, to lay the shotgun shell on the railroad track and use it for target practice.  So, they laid the shell on one track and used the opposite track to steady their aim.

Vern first, laying on his belly on the railroad embankment in direct line with the target.  He takes aim and fires…. Plink…. the shell spins around.  A near miss.  Rocks are placed next to the shell to prevent this from happening again.  Kenny is next, he lays down takes aim…. Plink…. hit a rock.

Now its Royal’s turn.  He cocks the BB gun, wets his finger and wipes the front sight and says, “alright boys I’ll show you how its done”. He lays down takes careful aim and says “I’ve got a bead on it…. plink and BOOM!  Royal flies backward head over heels down the embankment.  Terrified, Kenny and Vern run down, roll him over, WHEW, he’s alive, but when they look at his forehead, a perfectly round imprint!  “WINCHESTER 12-GAUGE”.

This was told to me (by my Brother Vern) as a true story.  I have no doubt that it is.  We got away with some pretty dumb things growing up in Webb City, MO.
