# My Funniest Memory WCHS Class of ‘61

Growing up in a small town like Webb City had it’s advantages.  One was that during our high school years we pretty much knew every one of our classmates.  We knew who they were, where they lived, who was dating who, details like that.  Most importantly for the guys, we knew if a classmate had a car, what make, what year, six cylinder or eight, automatic transmission or manual, three speed or four, column shift or floor, two door, four door, hard top, convertible, coupe or sedan.  I think you get the picture, we knew every detail, even about their parent’s car, if they didn’t own one.

The funny thing that happened to me concerned cars.  Someone started a custom among the guys that went like this.  If you were driving down the road and recognized someone meeting you, instead of honking, waving or flashing your lights, you would change lanes with them.  In other words you would move over to the left lane and he to the right lane.  Now this required some skill and a good sense of timing and wouldn’t be attempted in heavy traffic.  But when we could, we would do it because it was soooo cool.  

One fine day as I was driving my (and my brother’s) Model A Ford coupe South on Jefferson Ave. having just crossed over Mc Arthur drive heading for the Madison Inn.  I saw David Powell coming down the hill towards me, there was no other traffic so I switched lanes.  A little time passed and David had not changed lanes.  I proceeded on thinking “What is he doing? “ as we came closer and closer to one another.  Well when I saw smoke coming from the tires of the approaching car and whipped back over to my lane I realized, it wasn’t David Powell.  It was a little old lady, sitting dead stop, hands clutching the steering wheel and eyes as big as pies.  

This was the funny thing that happened to me.  I don’t think the little old lady thought it was very funny.
