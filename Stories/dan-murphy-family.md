They met at Lakeside Park where Dan ran a Shooting Gallery. Vera’s family visited often for entertainment and recreation as many families did in those days. After they were married, they lived in Webb City where they rented an apartment on South Rhone Street. Their first son Melvin Lee Murphy was born Aug.30 1937, and David Allen Murphy was born Feb. 23, 1940. In the early days of their marriage Dan worked for the Blake Movie Theater where he played the Organ and did sound effects for the silent movies, he also read the movie subtitles for people in the audience who couldn’t read. About 1940 or 1941 they moved to Arkansas City, KN. Where Dan worked with Walt and Bill Deer at their Gambling Hall.  James Lester Murphy was born Feb. 18, 1943. Approximately six months later they moved back to Webb City and bought a house at 603 N. Liberty St.  Dan owned and operated a liquor store on North Main St in Joplin at Stones Corner. Vern Eugene Murphy was born March 20, 1949. Dan became somewhat of an entrepreneur, starting and operating several businesses in and around Joplin and Webb City. Vera was a stay-at-home Mother and was active in the PTA At Webster Elementary School for many years and a Den Mother for Boy Scouts for a few years. She was also highly active in her Church, Webb City First Baptist where she taught Sunday School for fifty years.

mom had an old Brownie Hawkeye camera which she used for years. 

I’m adding a photo of Me and Melvin and David in our front yard next to the porch. Taken some time in the 40’s. The original photo was taken by the person who owned the pony and made photos of many kids in Webb city as he traveled across the USA. The original was black and white, they didn’t have color film in those days. The photo was colorized by hand which was quite an art form in the day.

Note there is no tv in the room. The old Philco radio used to be in that corner for years. When we finally got a TV (I think we were the last family in Webb City to get one) Dad gave the radio to Uncle Elmer and Aunt Emma. Years later David went out to the farm and ask if they still had it, which they did. It was out in the shed behind the house. David kept it for several years then gave it to Vern who gave it to me more years after that.  I still have it. I can still remember when we kids would lay there on the floor and listen to the old radio programs. Sometimes we would tune in a foreign country on the short-wave band. England or Australia was the only two we could understand.
