## Jim & Kathy Murphy

### Jim:

**Born:** 2/18/43 Arkansas City Kansas

Family moved to Webb City when I was approximately six Months old. My dad was born and
raised in Webb City (WC) and of course Mom was from Joplin. I'm not sure how long the family
was in Kansas but I'm told everyone was glad to be back in Missouri.

I have three brothers, two older and one younger. Melvin is the oldest, six years older than I
and David is three years older than I am and Vern is the youngest, I am six years older than
Vern. I was really glad to see Vern come along, for six long years I was known as the “baby” of
the family.

We had a very happy childhood. WC is still a small town today but was much smaller in our
childhood days. WC was surrounded by farms when we were growing up but prior to that it
was a booming mining town. Abandoned lead and zink mines were all around us, it was a great
playground for us kids as we grew up. We also liked to hunt and fish and there were many
places to go near our little town. We had many Aunts and Uncles who owned farms north of
town, they were from the Baylor family. I think Dad's mother must have been a Baylor before
she married my Granddad Murphy. We didn't know either of them they had both passed on by
the time we came along. But we did know the Baylor’s and spent many happy summers visiting
and playing on their farms.

Dad was an entrepreneur long before entrepreneurs were cool. He owned many small
businesses (although not all at once), some I remember are, a liquor store near the Kansas
state line west of Joplin on Shoal Creek known as "Baghdad". There was also a small diner
next to the store, the property was rather large and there was also a park or picnic area down
the hill from the store and next to the river. We kids always enjoyed our visits to Baghdad, what
a great place to play, swim, fish, hunt and explore! We spent many happy hours there. Dad
also owned a small restaurant at seventh and range line in Joplin, a filling station in Duenweg,
another liquor store in Duenweg, A night club in Joplin known as "Dan's little Mexico" . He also
tried farming, we had two farms (we didn’t live there) one North of Webb City, not far from center
creek. It was one hundred acres of dirt and rocks. We tried growing peanuts one year and
strawberries the next, neither crop turned out very well. Mom had a nice garden out in the old
barnyard; she grew corn, melons, potatoes, green beans, radishes, lots of good stuff. I almost
cut my leg off with a corn knife while helping her in that garden, then I just knew we were going
to be killed as she drove over 100 MPH on the way to Doc Slaughter to get me stitched up.

We had an old work horse out there for a while; he looked like a Clydesdale only solid black,
really big. He didn’t take to us kids though, every time we managed to get on his back he would
head for the nearest tree and scrape us off.

The other farm was in Alba, only ten acres but plenty of rocks. We had some chickens and a
rooster, some beef steers (Four) a barn and small house. We kids had the chore of feeding the
animals every day. I remember we had to carry an ax handle every time we went into the barn
yard because that darn rooster would attack us. He got loose one day and went over to the
farm next to us and was killed by one of their fighting cocks, guess he wasn’t as mean as he
thought. We weren’t very sorry to see him go.

I remember Dave or Melvin did the driving since I wasn’t old enough yet. After the steers were
full grown dad had them butchered and packed and we ate them. It was pretty good meat but I

bet it would have been cheaper to go to the store and buy it.
Mom was a stay at home Mom as most Mothers were in those days. She was a great cook,
was always getting lots of good stuff from Grandmother Marison’s garden. We used to visit our
Grandmother Marison often; we always had a lot of fun around her place too. There was a
public park just a few blocks down Sixth Street and there was a really nice pool there, we spent
many happy hours in that pool. I don’t remember Grandfather Marison; he died when I was
three years old. Melvin and David remember him.

Mom was very active in all of our lives, she was a Boy Scout leader for Melvin and David, PTA
president, always volunteered for our school parties, plays and activities. Mom always made
sure we boys were in Church, a Baptist church naturally, since her father was a Baptist Minister.
Dad never went to church with us, he was a Catholic and we would go to church with him once
a year to the Thanksgiving Dinner, it was some kind of fundraiser for the church. She was a
Sunday school teacher for many years; they gave her a plaque at First Baptist in recognition of
sixty years of teaching. When she got the plaque she said “I think they are wrong, it was only
fifty years”.

After I graduated High School I spent six months active duty in the Missouri Army National
Guard. Eight weeks of basic training at Ft. Leonard wood, Mo. The remainder of my active duty
time was spent at Ft. Knox, Ky. where they taught me how to fix tanks. I joined the “Guard”
when I was still in High School, there was an Armory in WC and just about every boy in town
(including my two older brothers) joined up for the extra money. After I got back home I ended
up going to work in Tulsa Oklahoma for Cooks Paints. My brother David worked for Cooks in
Joplin and got me the job in Tulsa. I worked for them for about three years before getting a job
where I could use some of my Army training at North American Aviation. I worked there for over
eight years and loved it. We built parts for the Saturn/Apollo project which put man on the
moon.

While in Oklahoma I transferred to the Oklahoma National Guard and finished up my service
obligation. I and about five thousand other fine folks ended up getting laid off from North
American after the space program was over. I stayed around Tulsa and attended School at
Tulsa JR College for a year before returning to WC.

I worked for Tri-state trucking in Joplin for about a year in their accounting department. I didn’t
like that job at all but it was a good place to work while I was looking for another job. The other
job turned up in North Carolina, my brother Vern was working for Brown & Root construction
company that was building a Nuclear Power plant in Southport, right on the Cape Fear River.
Vern sent an application and they hired me.

This is where I met Kathy (Williams) who worked for the same company in the training
department. I was working there as an instrument technician and they ask me to teach an
extension course for Cape Fear Technical College in an after hours class on site. Kathy would
help me with my lesson plans, type my tests and such. We fell in love and were married in
Atlanta GA on August 30, 1974. We eloped to Atlanta since both of her parents had died about
a year earlier. Her Mother had a long struggle with cancer and her Dad died of a heart attack
one week before her Mother.

After the power plant was built and started up we moved to Jay Maine where I worked at a
paper mill being built for International Paper Company. Sean Patrick our first son was born in
Farmington Maine December 3, 1976 (Jay had no hospital). After the job in Maine I worked for
about one year In Alaska helping with the startup of the Trans- Alaska pipeline which was an
800 mile oil pipeline stretching from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. Kathy and Sean Patrick stayed
with her sister in NC while I was in Alaska. After the job in Alaska we ended up in Virginia where
I worked at another Nuclear Power Plant being built for Virginia Power. This is where Kevin
Michael was born May 8, 1980 and Katherine Michelle (Katie) was born November 11, 1981. I
continued to work in construction and startup of Nuclear Power Plants in the area; PA, NJ, VA
and one in Ill near Chicago commuting home on weekends. Finally in 1988 I went to work for
VA Power where I retired in July of 2000.

Kathy and I joined Goshen Baptist Church here in Spotsylvania County 1978 and have been
active members. All of our children were baptized there and Sean and his wife Jennifer were
married there.

This brings us up to the present time.

Bittner who died and left her with two children, Claude and Roberta. My Grandmother and
